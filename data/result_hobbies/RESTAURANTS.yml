    Some of the, some of the best food I have ever had was out of a, outside inside of a place that we drove up: null
    Sometimes I think we pay the babysitter as much as paying for their dinner: null
    Sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband: null
    Sunday brunch, all, all you can eat brunches.: null
    Sunday we went there,: null
    Taco Bell .: null
    Texas to me makes: null
    Th, now that's down in, Highland Park.: null
    Tha, that's one of the things, a good pasta means a lot to me.: null
    That he looks at the things that he eats: null
    That should get you close enough to, to be able to find it.: null
    That was nice .: null
    That was the best shrimp I have ever had in my life.: null
    That's a good Mexican place.: null
    That's a good place: null
    That's a good seafood place.: null
    That's always, that's always a concern, but just a nice quiet easy place: null
    That's as cheap as steaks some places: null
    That's at Skillman and L B J: null
    That's in Addison, off of Belt Line.: null
    That's one of my husband's pet peeves.: null
    That's one thing that I wish we had more of,: null
    That's our favorite.: null
    That's real good,: null
    That's too bad,: null
    That's wh, that's, that's where I grew up was down in Orlando.: null
    That's what I've heard, yeah.: null
    That's where we go to get steaks: null
    That's, a steak is something that I cook at home.: null
    That's, that's interesting, I was in submarines.: null
    That's, that's supposed to be a wonderful place.: null
    That, that was one of my favorite foods, was, was a, a, was a good steak or a hamburger.: null
    The end of last month.: null
    The last time we went to Cafe Pacific, it was Father's Day,: null
    ? The one thing I notice is it's just, about dining out that you probably can
      relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt, we find prohibited,
    : null
    The only thing is you have to wait.: null
    The restaurants down here seem like they have,: null
    The service is great.: null
    There's a place on Greenville called .: null
    There's a, a restaurant in, right outside of Reading, Pennsylvania,: null
    There's a, there's a second one downtown,: null
    There's an Italian restaurant over, over by the mall, over by, Plano Parkway there,: null
    They are good.: null
    They do list, list the fat,: null
    They do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three.: null
    They don't take reservations,: null
    They had a great desert bar.: null
    They had entertainment sometimes: null
    They had shrimp fixed probably six different ways.: null
    They have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want: null
    They have the most wonderful salads.: null
    They laughed: null
    They like to go pretty much where we like to go: null
    They might have another one,: null
    They often do ratings of restaurants,: null
    They were floating around: null
    They're both very good.: null
    They're not very,: null
    They're really a nice place you could take someone to eat.: null
    They've got one in Addison too, now,: null
    They, they, they're just spoiled rotten,: null
    This is going to give me: null
    This is, that's real funny you said that because we were coming back Sunday on Central from church: null
    Tia's is probably our favorite, restaurant there,: null
    Underwater acoustics.: null
    Usually they, they take your change and throw you a couple of mints in your hand and say thanks,: null
    Very, low key in terms of the people are from California,: null
    Vienna is a suburb of D C also in Virginia: null
    Vietnamese restaurant we went to, last week. It's great,: null
    W, here in Plano, we tend to go to Momo's a, l, fairly often.: null
    We do eat, eggs and, and milk products.: null
    We do the same thing.: null
    We do the same.: null
    We do, we're ovolacto.: null
    We don't usually take the kids when we go there,: null
    We eat at Shoney's.: null
    We fought with them for fortyfive minutes.: null
    We go into Dallas,: null
    We go to Grandy's quite a bit I would say.: null
    We go wh, more for the, Chinese: null
    We go, very, very often we go out for fajitas.: null
    We got this Premier Dining Card thing,: null
    We got, we got three kids, too,: null
    We have found, a number of restaurants either through D and the,: null
    We have one called Chi Chi's in th, in our area.: null
    We have two, two very special places in Northern Virginia that people go to.: null
    We like Chinese.: null
    We like it because it's fairly reasonable: null
    We like, seafood, also,: null
    We like, we do like international food,: null
    We lived in the Chicago area at the time,: null
    We sort of take turns.: null
    We think it's good.: null
    We tried a Bennigan's one time,: null
    We try to get out maybe once every month and a half or: null
    We used to do that, once in a while,: null
    We used to live in Oakland,: null
    We usually don't go for beef really anymore.: null
    We went there on my birthday in March it's great.: null
    We went to Gal,: null
    We were in Galveston last year aft, right aft, the first of this year, actually.: null
    We're almost in Dallas.: null
    We're just north of Dallas.: null
    We're usually picking things up quickly,: null
    We're, we're retired now.: null
    We've been to, Chefalia's.: null
    We've got a good Chinese restaurant in town.: null
    We've tried different ones when they've had them as one of the: null
    We've, I guess we eat out even less than I realize .: null
    We've, just recently discovered a super restaurant down here: null
    We, I guess we, we use the coupons, too.: null
    We, we enjoy Mexican food.: null
    We, we tend to eat at home.: null
    We, we waited almost fortyfive minutes before everything was brought out,: null
    What I miss up here is, I'm originally a Texan, and I miss home cooked Mexican.: null
    What the quality,: null
    When a new restaurant opens up, they usually send out coupons.: null
    When we do go out, in a way it's like a little mini vacation I guess,: null
    When we travel we look for Wendy's because we have kids,: null
    When we working out we ate out more than that .: null
    Where, where it's made,: null
    Wyatt's Cafeteria.: null
    You can get as dressed up or, a, just going to the local barbecue and just doing take out.: null
    You can usually get a variety of what you're looking for,: null
    You do feel like you've gone out, and done something,: null
    You have to be careful if you go to a, a restaurant that,: null
    You have, you have to expect to wait at least an hour.: null
    ? You know they have, women there going to S M U, going to, Southern Methodist
      University and, and graduating in opera or something like that
    : null
    You know what, we read, we read the, D MAGAZINE: null
    You know, } it's not that far.: null
    You may have sold a trip for some time.: null
    You pay totally on the honor system.: null
    You should fee, have a treat.: null
    You talk about spicy,: null
    You're full,: null
    a good turn over would be sort of nice.: null
    a lot of places that even don't look, don't look like much.: null
    a lot of times we do eat where we know.: null
    a lot of, one place that we went just recently: null
    a shrimp it's a shrimp dish,: null
    a, as long as you know that , it's okay.: null
    actually it's very easy for me, because I, I have a prac, make it a practice when I am out,: null
    actually the, the Steak And Ale out here,: null
    actually there's the Atlantic Cafe and Cafe Pacific, and,: null
    actually, I think we, we, we get a ha, we have a healthier diet than the average person.: null
    all my work has been in research for the Navy .: null
    also I like to be served.: null
    and just for color if nothing else.: null
    and just things, any, any eating area that you just don't have to wait an extreme amount of time.: null
    and things like, Souper Salads,: null
    around here the big spicy thing is buffalo wings: null
    around, I think it's a little past it's right before Midway, it's: null
    as far as missing living there, no.: null
    ? as out here you might have enjoyed the meal and go away feeling satisfied, it's
      not so much a, an event, out in the suburbs when you go to a local restaurant.
    : null
    at least it's fruit and stuff there .: null
    at least once a week.: null
    back on the Italian, we went to some place across from Collin Creek Mall that absolutely putrid for Italian food.: null
    basically Mexican food.: null
    because they have got a good rate on, good prices and everything.: null
    being from Dallas, I think we have an average of six or seven restaurants that open and close every we, month: null
    believe you me it wasn't easy to give up ,: null
    besides, because y, chicken and: null
    cause with two we have a problem,: null
    don't have to wait forever for a table.: null
    down in the Gulf I've eaten a bunch of those little seafood shacks, we've called them.: null
    down near the Highway Twelve area, is Gershwin's,: null
    ? during the week they often have, a, a limited menu choice but, very reasonable
      complete dinners for six ninetynine that included
    : null
    either one of those two, you go through a hundred bucks without half trying,: null
    especially like good prime rib: null
    ? everybody, every child that I even know that eats vegetables, looked five years
      old still after a certain age realized that there is something called a McDonald's.
    : null
    except that this makes me fat.: null
    fish, for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either Vincent's: null
    five of them, they're good,: null
    for dessert we thought we had just stuffed ourselves .: null
    for instance, we, we had a Scout dinner last night we went to.: null
    for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to want to go eat lasagna and garlic bread .: null
    fruit and vegetables: null
    he likes it kind of: null
    he realizes what they are: null
    he said, "I keep hearing good things about that place,: null
    he says free ice cream .: null
    he stays in the same restaurant for twenty years,: null
    he went down and bought some at a: null
    he'll just eat chips until we've got three or four baskets coming back.: null
    he's a fan of, of Dairy Queen,: null
    he's got a big clientele: null
    he's grown up.: null
    he, he in the beginning, began for health reasons.: null
    her coach is in California.: null
    here a couple years ago my wife and I went to Seattle on vacation.: null
    here they have to entertain us to make us come back.: null
    here, basically, you go to an Italian restaurant or you go to a Mexican restaurant,: null
    i, I'm originally from Connecticut: null
    if I could have a good small restaurant or a good large restaurant I'd go to the good small restaurant.: null
    if I have a coupon we can go there: null
    if not we can't, because it's cheaper: null
    if we really want to, something different we go to Modesto: null
    if you go out to dinner, there's virtually, there's not a whole lot of things you can get.: null
    if you're looking for a very,: null
    in Texas we got it from the Gulf.: null
    ? in fact if I could pick my, restaurants on how their coffee is and how their
      french bread is and the butter and the desert I would be,
    : null
    in fact, we do a lot more entertaining I think at home than we do going out.: null
    in fact, you're about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that.: null
    in spite of the fact I've spoken so badly about chains, chain restaurants, we, do like Shoney's pretty well,: null
    in the Addison, about everything that you could want in Dallas is in the Addison area, anyway.: null
    it always kills me cause I don't like the, the decorations so much: null
    it changed hands and doubled the prices: null
    it doesn't really matter to him.: null
    it finally went out of business.: null
    it goes up into Colorado and down here.: null
    it had strawberries, kiwis, and raspberries: null
    it had white tablecloth,: null
    it includes, salad and rolls and, some other stuff,: null
    it is delicious.: null
    it is fab, fantastic.: null
    it is wonderful.: null
    it is, it's a whole experience.: null
    it just, it just varies,: null
    it really is a treat,: null
    it starts with a K.: null
    it used to be a Northern Telecom Building in the ba, in the ground floor.: null
    it was a small restaurant, just kind of out of the way,: null
    it was exce,: null
    it was excellent.: null
    it was good,: null
    it was good.: null
    it was just terrible.: null
    it was mainly baseball teams: null
    it was outstanding.: null
    it was plenty because it was very rich: null
    it was really nice.: null
    it was terrible.: null
    it was the m, it was the most wonderful food.: null
    it was wonderful.: null
    it was, it's really difficult in the area if you don't have, the products that you can get.: null
    it was, we were ready: null
    it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was, just to, have a moment of peace and quiet without: null
    it's , it's all the garlic bread and all the,: null
    it's Cajun type stuff.: null
    it's a Chinese,: null
    it's a good restaurant.: null
    it's a great place.: null
    it's a little bit with th, the meat market atmosphere,: null
    it's a paperback: null
    it's a very elegant nice place to eat.: null
    it's actually very inexpensive,: null
    it's all chocolate, made like a paper bag: null
    it's almost a hobby with us.: null
    it's already in front of them when you sit down,: null
    it's already prepared: null
    it's at Plano Road and Campbell.: null
    it's been a long time since we've been in there: null
    it's called Rodolfo's: null
    it's either T V dinners at home or we go out to eat.: null
    it's foggy and cold here.: null
    it's gone .: null
    it's good stuff,: null
    it's great,: null
    it's hysterical.: null
    it's in the lower floor,: null
    it's in the strip, yeah,: null
    it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant.: null
    it's just my husband and I,: null
    it's just on my mind,: null
    it's just so much different than to eat something that's been frozen.: null
    it's just so much food .: null
    it's just this big beautiful Italian restaurant.: null
    it's just, it closed recently.: null
    it's kind of funny is sometimes we're we all want different things,: null
    it's like being in It,: null
    it's like continental French restaurant or something really: null
    it's like, I can't go anywhere where I: null
    it's not a cheap place,: null
    it's on Campbell. It, it's north of Campbell, but, off Central,: null
    it's on the honor system.: null
    it's on, Parker and Central Expressway: null
    it's on, it's in Addison,: null
    it's one of these situations where nobody's going to restrain what you eat,: null
    it's pressed.: null
    it's probably the best tasting,: null
    it's real good Mexican food.: null
    it's really a nice restaurant: null
    it's really good.: null
    it's really not in town.: null
    it's rolled up into, into something,: null
    it's so hot.: null
    it's some famous steak place over in Addison.: null
    it's supposed to be good for you.: null
    it's supposed to be very similar to,: null
    it's the fastest thing to do,: null
    it's too much,: null
    it's very expensive.: null
    it's very nice.: null
    it's very pretty inside,: null
    it's where Skillman, curves into Forest Lane: null
    it's wonderful, particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that.: null
    it's worth the wait.: null
    it's, it was a wonderful, wonderful experience.: null
    it's, it's a chain down he,: null
    it's, it's a good change and, a good change from cooking and eating at home: null
    it's, it's buffet,: null
    it's, it's just fabulous food.: null
    it's, it's really great.: null
    it's, it's sort of like Hollywood in a way because there's, there's favorite haunts for Southerners and things like that.: null
    it's, it's, it's a lot of fun.: null
    it's, not part of a chain: null
    it's, so it's very, very mixed: null
    it, it was just fabulous.: null
    ? it, it's a big, tall, it's the tallest building on the west side, northwest
      side of Campbell and, just before you get to Campbell
    : null
    just at home.: null
    just wonderful: null
    just, it's just not,: null
    last weekend we went out for Italian also,: null
    let me see, for New Year's we went to eat at Uncle Julio's.: null
    like I said, some of our very favorites are the Chinese restaurants, just to,: null
    like we could probably take our oldest son and,: null
    lot of the big name brand, I guess, chains: null
    lunch today was eighteen dollars.: null
    maybe we avoided Wendy's the last few years because our daughter worked there: null
    me I'm like I said seafood I'm,: null
    me too, because I eat out a lot.: null
    mine enjoy that too.: null
    mine is, monetarily, I guess strongly monetarily based.: null
    most French food always leaves me hungry for some reason.: null
    most of the restaurants are, they tend to be, American style food.: null
    most of the seafood's frozen.: null
    most of them are gone now: null
    most of those things were a little more northern Italy.: null
    mostly when we go out, it's my husband and I,: null
    much better.: null
    my birthday's coming up,: null
    my four year old he, he still,: null
    my husband and I like getting the salads or the lighter meals: null
    my husband and I like veal,: null
    my husband does.: null
    my husband has changed.: null
    my husband has just gotten stuck.: null
    my husband likes that.: null
    my husband really likes their ribs.: null
    my husband was aghast because I ate turnip greens and liked it.: null
    my husband would coach,: null
    my husband's going upstairs,: null
    my husband's kind of the eth, he, he's the ethnic fan.: null
    my inlaws also enjoy prime rib, when they've: null
    my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti: null
    my little girl likes, Spaghetti Warehouse: null
    my littlest girl she's still wants McDonald's, McDonald's, McDonald's .: null
    my other older two they can.: null
    my sister and brotherinlaw were going to take us out for dinner: null
    my two littlest,: null
    my wife has a, a friend that w, runs one of the restaurants down there: null
    my wife is an A one cook,: null
    my, softball unit here is acting like he's dying of poison .: null
    no particular reason,: null
    not just that, I try to, that's a big part of it. } I try to get my money's worth.: null
    not that I know of.: null
    now he, he feels like I do.: null
    now there's a good place in Addison too called Blue Mesa Grill: null
    now there's a new Italian place Sfuzi: null
    now there's one in Addison.: null
    now we both think a lot of what is it we're eating in relation to what it's going to give to our bodies.: null
    now we, we, we branch out at this Wendy's or some other fast food joint.: null
    now, of course, they've added the Taiwanese,: null
    ? o, originally the two, the, the guy who owns the Cafe Pacific and th, the guy
      who owns the Atlantic Cafe, were partners in the Atlantic Cafe.
    : null
    of course we've got D C to call on,: null
    of course, we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers: null
    on going out, I like steaks.: null
    on one hand I see that: null
    on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves .: null
    on the other hand, my older sister: null
    on the weekends there's always things to do,: null
    once in a while things backfire.: null
    once they, give, they no longer give coupons. We'll, we'll, we'll stay there.: null
    one down there is the, I think it's an old schoolhouse.: null
    one of my favorites were: null
    one of our favorites is Pappasito's.: null
    one of our, one of our favorites is a chain. Shoney's.: null
    one place I'd never been that I would really like to go to, is Lawry's.: null
    one's called Captain Pell's: null
    other than that, they, leave you go about five minutes,: null
    ? other then that I don't know we, we do our share of pizza eating too, but more
      like go get it and carry it in cause we're too,
    : null
    our favorite thing on Fridays, we generally order pizza in: null
    our favorite when you have a little more to spend, is to go to Taiwan or May Dragon.: null
    over on Preston Road and Royal Lane I believe.: null
    particularly, down in your area, I'm looking for some, some more restaurants.: null
    people come all over the country amazed at, the abuse they were seized.: null
    people go there to be abused.: null
    people here buy a half a cow: null
    people just go in there and just pig out and everything.: null
    pr, pretty sure it was original, Original Book Binders: null
    primarily lunch, and breakfast sometimes: null
    really Pappasito's we love,: null
    really it's, they're a lot better than what I get in the restaurant .: null
    really, I'm kind of open on food.: null
    recently we have been hitting Pancho's up.: null
    right in Chinatown, so we went to lots of restaurants: null
    seven courses isn't what I usually look for .: null
    she enjoys eating out,: null
    she has a lot,: null
    she never wanted us to show up there: null
    she went there for six years.: null
    she's happy.: null
    she's six months: null
    she, is a world champion twirler: null
    shrimp straight out of the bay.: null
    some of those and get fajitas,: null
    somebody said to me in terms of,: null
    somehow along the way, when I come back to my seat, I have too much.: null
    something nice.: null
    something's happened here,: null
    sometimes I've been when I thought, it wasn't as good,: null
    sometimes Mark and I, that's my husband Mark,: null
    sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and, and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal,: null
    sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad.: null
    sometimes it's, I enjoy it's, I enjoy going out having a formal meal.: null
    sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a Wendy's,: null
    sometimes we'll go,: null
    that always just bothered me: null
    that has a great, it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in Dallas,: null
    that is really super kind of stuff, too. Take, if you like Continental at all: null
    that is, if you like continental stuff, that is really nice.: null
    that makes a difference.: null
    that might be why I look for inexpensive places: null
    that place is known for the, the rudest waitresses in the country, are, are at the Vienna Inn.: null
    that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track: null
    that was a no no.: null
    that was, not just really super.: null
    that way they can get their burgers and fries: null
    that's Houston's.: null
    that's Mexican, right across from on the Dillard's side there,: null
    that's an old established, restaurant.: null
    that's down in the, the Stoneleigh Hotel now.: null
    that's happened before.: null
    that's it's really, kind of lively.: null
    that's just it,: null
    that's not what I heard,: null
    that's on the nights we can't decide.: null
    that's one of the few,: null
    that's one thing,: null
    that's our nice place to go.: null
    that's something we don't get here,: null
    that's supposed to be wonderful.: null
    that's the first thing we look for,: null
    that's the way it is here in Colorado, also.: null
    that's the way with my husband.: null
    that's what I mean by,: null
    that's what I worked on.: null
    that's where we always go,: null
    that's, one of the things th, that I do enjoy when you get a good restaurant.: null
    that's, that's a very good place to eat, The Blue Mesa Grill.: null
    that's, that's the way I,: null
    that, that is really one of our,: null
    that, that stuff is, goes one notch beyond,: null
    that, that's about it.: null
    that, you get more, fruit and maybe cottage cheese or a chicken breast or things that aren't as,: null
    the atmosphere there is really, really nice.: null
    the dish was dirty,: null
    the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best.: null
    the first one we've been to that, I don't think there was anything on the menu, that, that any of us had: null
    the food is good,: null
    the food's already served: null
    the girls wear kimonos and,: null
    the guy started Cafe Pacific.: null

    their seafood was wonderful.: null
    their veal dishes have been good.: null
    their, their fruits are always exceptional.: null

    then I quit work and everything: null
    then fajitas are one of my,: null
    ? then there's a place up the pass, up in the mountains that we pretty reliably
      like to go to on some Sunday mornings, drive, drive up to, I think it's about
      eight thousand foot elevation.

      the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product

    we probably go out one to two times a week.: null
    we really enjoy prime rib, too,: null
    we really, we really do enjoy going out: null
    we sit there for an hour waiting to get in: null
    we still find it fun.: null
    we tend to,: null
    we think that was real good: null
    we tried, what was across the street, El Paso's: null
    we try and go around to different Mexican restaurants trying them out,: null
    we try new places: null
    we try to hit those places when we can.: null
    we used to eat there, we used to eat there all the time.: null
    we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there: null
    we used to,: null
    we usually have Chinese once a month.: null
    we usually head on down, what's the freeway down here?: null
    we usually stick by it.: null
    we went in there, actually we went in there for lunch one day.: null
    we went to El Sorrento.: null
    we went to a place called Grishman's in Greenville,: null
    we went to one Italian,: null
    we were never home at the same time.: null
    we were taking, four, five and six people out .: null
    we were there a few months ago,: null
    we would go over there to,: null
    we wouldn't have that problem, because we're not vegetarians.: null
    we'll go down to, Blue Mesa Grill, Mexican food,: null
    we'll go even in town here at times, just as a, a change although: null
    we'll go get pizza and, at Little Caesar's, although the kids prefer Domino's.: null
    we'll go in.: null
    we'll go to them all.: null
    we'll stick with it: null
    we'll try, we'll try anything.: null
    we're always searching around for Chinese.: null
    we're both, my husband and I are vegetarians.: null
    we're excited,: null
    we're getting ready to: null
    we're getting ready to go overseas to adopt.: null
    we're in cattle country.: null
    we're in the mountains in Virginia.: null
    we're pretty fortunate.: null
    we're pretty much regulars at an Italian, local Italian restaurant.: null
    ? we're sort of in the middle of, the extension of the Cajun country too, we have,
      a lot of ambiance provided by, the, the bands and everyth, like you said jazz
      bands and things like that.
    : null
    we're taking thirty years ago,: null
    we're trying to give them a little patronage.: null
    we're very attracted to exotic food.: null
    we're, we're supposed to be talking about dinning out,: null
    we've been back,: null
    we've been down there and had French cuisine,: null
    we've eat, we eat out so much it's gotten so I don't like to really eat any place: null
    we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons,: null
    we've gone for Romanian food and Lebanese food, and things like that: null
    we've got beautiful places to go.: null
    we've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that that's, that's usually the way we'll go: null
    we've had experience with that, too.: null
    we've never been there.: null
    we've really gotten to like,: null
    we've tried places, down, by the Collin Creek Mall,: null
    we've, we've been going to all sorts of weird type places with it.: null
    we've, we've usually, we often save those and ventured out on, from there, just for something that had a high rating.: null
    we, I live in a farming community.: null
    we, our dining is very limited .: null
    we, we also go to Chili's and, Colter's Bar B Q,: null
    we, we can eat a lot of fast food .: null
    we, we check that and, the Friday section in the newspaper: null
    we, we do enjoy that.: null
    we, we do too.: null
    we, we like spicy food down here, especially, the hot sauce, Picante sauce, or salsa: null
    we, we really like the Mexican food, here in Texas: null
    we, we sure go through a lot of that .: null
    we, we usually eat out generally two or three times a week.: null
    we, we, we rarely go eat in those kind of eating, situations, any more.: null
    west out of Colorado Springs.: null
    what we'd really like, if, if we just have a, a casual evening is Houston's.: null
    when I was a vegan, it's,: null
    when he goes to Maine, he eats lobster, I guess, at least twice a day, all the time he's up there .: null
    when my husband and I go out we have four children.: null
    when my husband and I go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere: null
    when they say, buy one get one free.: null
    when we do go out we really, want to be wowed by, the presentation, so to speak.: null
    when we go out, I'm always looking for something other than the standard menu, even if,: null
    when we have something to celebrate, we head to Houston's.: null
    when, when I go out, it's, it's normally to get, some specialty type of food: null
    when, when we dine out we go to medium priced restaurants.: null
    where we're from, it's, it's pretty limited,: null
    which I'm not Italian,: null
    with my husband traveling he can get all he needs: null
    yet I hate to cook food at home: null
    yet, we haven't, as human beings, haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically: null
    you always stand in line when you go: null
    you can always blame it on having children,: null
    you can ask them and they'll tell you whether or not they use lard or,: null
    you can eat a whole big plate of their food, and you really don't feel like you've eaten too much.: null
    ? you can get everything here from, a very spicy Indian meal to, the favorite
      barbecue and, and, just anything your little hearts desires around here,
    : null
    you can get that too.: null
    you don't feel stuffed and miserable.: null
    you don't get stuffed on their food it seems.: null
    you don't have to spend that much,: null
    you don't have to wait,: null
    you eat your crawfish and: null
    you get the crabs: null
    you get, one free: null
    you go out to get the chicken wings: null
    you have the pick of the, the crop here.: null
    you have to get up for that.: null
    you have to go all the way to Dallas.: null
    you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in.: null
    you have to watch it if you go out to eat: null
    you just take a drink of wine: null
    you know, how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then: null
    you na, okay you name it.: null
    you really don't.: null
    you tell them what you've eaten and what you drank or whatever: null
    you wind up waiting about an hour: null
    you're in New York,: null
    you're lucky if you get change.: null
    you're satisfied,: null
    you've got one down in, down near, Addison,: null
    you, you, you pay for one now, and: null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    A lot of people don't know that.: null
    Although I guess on this topic are to talk about the, service in a restaurant is always nice though, too: null
    Because of all the pollution in the lakes and the,: null
    Becky, you know, even if you lived off your own land, that you would have to put caution signs,: null
    Chi Chi's is a national restaurant, I think.: null
    ? Course if you find a place you like and it works out that no one else likes
      it, it would be sort of sad to see it go under.
    : null
    Especially with butter and honey on them .: null
    Even though traditional it can backfire.: null
    Everything we eat.: null
    Everything,: null
    I don't know if we are particularly adventurous,: null
    I don't like to go to the drivethrus because sometimes they get your order wrong: null
    I don't think so .: null
    I don't think there's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have.: null
    ? I guess if you were having, if you were trying to impress somebody w, like taking
      somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good
      restaurant.
    : null
    I guess we should continue on,: null
    I know a lot of their, a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things,: null
    I suppose if you really believe in something it's,: null
    I suppose you'd say I,: null
    I think it's sort of a waste of money to go real, to a real high priced restaurant.: null
    I think maybe if you were somewhere like California, where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants: null
    I think that it's just, that's ex,: null
    I think that peo, that we just tend to eat, overeat.: null
    I think that some of it's over priced.: null
    I think that's a shame.: null
    I think that's what: null
    I think you will enjoy that.: null
    I think you, you, you balance the foods,: null
    I think, that's pleasurable for all of us, if we choose the right restaurant .: null
    I was more in the mood for french toast any way: null
    I'm going to be, I'm going to starve to death: null
    I'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as I possibly can,: null
    I, I can almost live on, on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if I had to.: null
    I, I don't know whether it's age or what it is.: null
    If you want a really special night out and fish food: null
    It really is a great place.: null
    It sounds like that it would probably,: null
    It was one of these you have bad experience and,: null
    It wasn't that bad,: null
    It would be good I think,: null
    It would mean a lot to the looks of the plate.: null
    It's nice to find a place like that.: null
    It's really sad isn't it cause it's hard to get them away from junk then.: null
    It's very expensive to go out to eat.: null
    It's, it's important.: null
    It, it, it's the way to spend a nice Sunday morning.: null
    Just to die for exactly.: null
    Maryland's great,: null
    Maybe it's not too bad.: null
    Of course you want the food to be good: null
    Of course, down, next to downtown up around McKinney and everything: null
    Of course, not too many people want to rush back to Panama City, Panama, the country, Panama.: null
    Our lives are, are built around foods that we like and, an, nutritionally good for us.: null
    Probably needed some cold beer with it: null
    Someone has been lying to you.: null
    Taco Bueno's good .: null
    That is probably very fortunate for you.: null
    That sound good.: null
    That sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it's not that great: null
    That's what you find,: null
    The food is probably,: null
    The place of the seventies .: null
    Then this will probably,: null
    There's very few places that you, I'll bet that you could,: null
    They are, they just, they're excellent, excellent food.: null
    They can, they can do things to shrimp that, that no one else can.: null
    They do those real corny commercials.: null
    They use the, they use the insides of the animals, heart and liver: null
    They won't put up with that.: null
    They're easy .: null
    Things that are kind of oddball, like, Thai cuisine,: null
    Unless somebody is trying to blackball them.: null
    We don't synthesize the, the calcium the: null
    We, we slough some of it,: null
    We, we throw more of it off: null
    What they use is roast beef.: null
    When you find the right cookbook, why it works out.: null
    You can eat: null
    You can't get away from it: null
    You go somewhere else.: null
    You got one coming.: null
    You'd like it especially it you're adventuresome.: null
    You're brave .: null
    Your body just doesn't accept vitamins: null
    a lot of them are the same no matter where you stop.: null
    a lot of times the foods,: null
    a waitress or waiter that waits the table, it's nice that they're attentive: null
    actually you can get everything you need through vegetables.: null
    and, and cheap too.: null
    as with anything, it's preparation.: null
    because they use everything they can and make this into pressed whatever.: null
    carry a bread bar that is just out of this world .: null
    catfish is wonderful.: null
    evidently people go in there and they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough and they complain: null
    food is a very intriguing thing.: null
    from New York it probably doesn't matter,: null
    if it's, nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that,: null
    in order to survive in this area , I think they have to be good.: null
    in, in, in the countries, unless it's a large city, I guess Dairy Queen and WalMart are their main .: null
    inside yourself you just, it's not right.: null
    it costs a lot of money to do it too.: null
    it is absolutely wonderful.: null
    it is, it's fabulous.: null
    it may, it may help their tip, may not,: null
    it seems like it would be portions would be the big thing.: null
    it sounds wonderful.: null
    it sure is good,: null
    it was pretty reasonable.: null
    it was really nice.: null
    it wasn't too bad it really wasn't: null
    it worked out fine.: null
    it would probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and: null
    it's a good place to go.: null
    it's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave: null
    it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals.: null
    it's just a lot cheaper than, than Domino's,: null
    it's kind of nice to,: null
    it's not healthy,: null
    it's not nice when they're too attentive.: null
    ? it's really strange that, that, that seafood is so expensive, because when you,
      in reality, I, say that, the oceans have the greatest re, resource of food
    : null
    it's really, it's tempting when you come home from work: null
    it's very good it's all of these run adult males,: null
    it's, it's really good. All their blackened grill stuff.: null
    it, it makes you more aware of what you're eating.: null
    it, it's fun.: null
    it, it's kind of pricey,: null
    it, people, they,: null
    just a, just a change of pace: null
    most kids do.: null
    most of these places are pretty much just, theme restaurants: null
    must have had some interesting, assignments for you there.: null
    now that's surprising: null
    now the Red Lobster I found is very nice at lunchtime.: null
    of course, it's just so much easier and simpler: null
    ? of course, when you talk about Mexican cuisine you, that's kind of like talking
      about American food or Chinese food, because its regional, too.
    : null

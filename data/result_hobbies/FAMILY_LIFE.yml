    I'm, I've, I've lived here forever,: null
    I've always had my own checking account since I was in tenth grade.: null
    I've always thought about maybe transferring up there,: null
    ? I've always tried to do things with them, like, when you're at the little league,
      helping out even though I'm not a good athlete myself,
    : null
    I've always worked, from the time that they were little: null
    I've been babysitting this child, for about eight years,: null
    I've been calling a lot of companies.: null
    I've been lucky in that respect that I don't, don't travel too much .: null
    I've been off doing my thing all day: null
    I've been real pleased with that, too.: null
    I've even cut that down now,: null
    I've even noticed that with my five year old. She started kindergarten this year,: null
    I've found that, it's really important to me to get to read.: null
    I've got a daughter that's a sophomore at U T: null
    I've got two boys, one four year old one two years old,: null
    I've got two children: null
    I've gotten some good ideas from you .: null
    I've heard, we have a couple of friends that goes to Washington quite often,: null
    I've helped out ,: null
    I've just learned about that breed.: null
    I've never got off of level one .: null
    I've noticed that.: null
    I've put a lot more emphasis on that, on my kids: null
    I've seen it in magazines and stuff where you dress your animals up and take them to a par,: null
    I've seen my uncle and his family, does everything together,: null
    I've seen some people that are really quite up there: null
    I've thought about it myself: null
    I've tried to spend more time with, the children since then.: null
    I've watched him grow up: null
    I've, I never read a lot growing up: null
    I've, I tell myself sometimes, just sit down after work,: null
    I've, I've heard of that.: null
    I've, I've helped out extremely,: null
    I've, I've noticed, another thing, when I was younger my father was always working.: null
    I've, two kids right now: null
    I, I I talk to parents about this a lot.: null
    I, I always said that if I had a kid they wouldn't know what McDonald's is.: null
    I, I am in, I am in a different situation.: null
    I, I can only rera, relate now to my grandchildren.: null
    I, I could go to work,: null
    I, I don't care if I ever see any,: null
    I, I don't even know what they're talking about.: null
    I, I don't even think we had ,: null
    I, I don't have any children,: null
    I, I don't think I ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family.: null
    I, I feel like that it helped me now because I appreciate the value of the dollar,: null
    I, I found that, it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time.: null
    I, I guess I felt fairly fortunate that I was able to do that.: null
    I, I had plenty of snow,: null
    I, I have five children all together.: null
    I, I helped out with it.: null
    I, I hope to, of course, be able to teach them right from wrong.: null
    ? I, I know that, my daughter, even though she goes out with the, the sports and
      everything, she likes to watch the football for, the kids .
    : null
    I, I never, I don't even know what day care is really all about because I, I never went to a day care center,: null
    I, I remember whenever I was growing up, often times spent with my Dad was, just wonderful, go,: null
    I, I started working parttime when they were in, junior high school and high school,: null
    ? I, I suppose they are trying to get through to them that daddy is not home because,
      he is out working trying to make some money for, we can buy you this bike and
      that toy and so forth,
    : null
    I, I taught school for six years.: null
    I, I think, I think this is a good closing point.: null
    I, I think, our kids just always dearly loved that, play bounce the ball, or: null
    I, I told him, listen you could have had a lot of money if you would have only had two kids.: null
    I, I took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little: null
    I, I tried it once or twice,: null
    I, I try to go out of my way to, to plan things that he can do with the kids because,: null
    I, I used to play soccer when I was that age: null
    I, I was aware, vaguely aware of it,: null
    I, I was in physical education then: null
    I, I'm a firm believer in that, too.: null

    I, I, I realize that,: null
    I, have a set of twins that are fourteen: null
    I, is, I'm not sure which one we went into,: null
    I, it, that choice was there,: null
    ? I, last year, I had a little part time job in a private, high school, tutoring,

    I, we, we got married a few months ago: null
    I, you know, to ha, I was an only child,: null

    In my household, we have a little bit, of, uh, a fight for whose boss.: null
    It costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose.: null
    It happens that way .: null
    It is a financial sacrifice to make because we go from two incomes down to one.: null
    It keeps them busy.: null
    It sounds to me like, you're doing well.: null
    It was a magic number for him: null
    It was just a recorded message,: null
    It was like that they thought that's the way life was,: null
    It wasn't really conversation,: null
    It's I love you: null
    It's a wonderful, it's wonderful to be a mother: null
    It's just the kids like to, being together as a family.: null
    It's like you said, to each his own.: null
    It's not going to be too many more years before I, they'll be gone: null
    It's that's no problem here.: null
    It's where we originally started out,: null

    Whenever I do have children I, I'm going to try as hard as I can to s, see that we spend a lot of time together,: null
    Whereas, I'm the type of person, I could not sit,: null
    With every passing day we wonder if we will be.: null
    You can have birthday parties there: null
    You fit it in with all that, that.: null
    You know, I have, uh, some friends that, uh,: null
    You know, I just worry,: null
    You know, mine were just all, uh, strays in the neighborhood.: null
    You know, my cats do not wear clothes,: null
    You know, they've really become very much involved in, in just that one organization,: null
    a couple of hours later I'm home.: null
    a lot of people that I work for are, mothers that stay home.: null
    a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers that are more, where they could manage their own schedule: null
    a lot of them played it,: null
    a lot of times, she and I will travel to writers conferences together.: null
    a lot of times, whenever we head out of town on a trip or something,: null
    a slap here and there,: null
    a thing such as,: null
    a very, family thing, made, go skiing in Vermont or something.: null
    about the time I got out of working that long hours was when the, when the twins were about three years old.: null
    activities for, for children now are,: null
    again, I know it sounds like a rationalization,: null
    all seven are in a sport,: null
    all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports,: null
    all the ones I know,: null
    all the traveling I do is alone.: null
    all the, the, the rides are free.: null
    also the girls are in softball: null
    although I have brought my boys into to see where I work, it's not that easy,: null
    ? although, it wasn't them playing I notice whenever I was playing softball and
      such, my mom and dad got into it more than I did.
    : null
    amazingly a lot of times it's real easy.: null
    and I always got all the attention,: null
    and I can't turn a hungry cat down.: null
    and I know they spend a lot of time with them.: null
    and I looked out there: null
    and I said, I can't stand it,: null
    and I said, I just can not have another cat,: null
    and I'm like, ugh, you know.: null
    and I'm like, well why can't Ashley be at the wedding .: null
    and Jerry just kept saying you are the meanest person .: null
    and Plano, Texas rather than Plano, Illinois.: null
    and he really liked it: null
    and he really likes riding that around.: null
    and he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and all,: null
    and it just kind of built.: null
    and it was winter time: null
    and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that.: null
    and one is twentyfive.: null
    and people run over them: null
    and she does not want to be around other cats.: null
    and she just, uh, she wants to be around human beings: null
    and she says things like, I'm really glad when he comes home: null
    and so that's the big battle here, you know,: null
    and that was all it, all it lasted for.: null
    and the last one that I pic, was here, uh,: null
    ? and the other thing we try to do is, uh, since the here is, uh, sign him up
      for, and her, for, uh, different activities at like the rec center or something
      like swimming,
    : null
    and the other was in the Brownies: null
    ? and then all of a sudden the father was getting involved with doing nature hikes
      for them and working with the Girl Scout camp he, here in Dallas and then going
      out to, uh, Betty Perot camp and working with the horses and stuff
    : null
    and then she spread it to her, her li, younger sister and her brother: null
    and then she's saying, you know, you can't let them outside: null
    and then the mother got involved as a leader: null
    and then the other day my husband and I met a couple who, who,: null
    and they go away for weekends and in the winter time even, you know, to do work with the Girl Scouts: null
    and they got it just at the beginning of the vacation, where she got better.: null
    and they raise champion cats.: null
    and they really like each other.: null
    and they take their girls: null
    and they will eventually.: null
    and they're gone a lot: null
    and they've slapped the dogs around too .: null
    and they, they go on family vacations: null
    and too they can catch diseases really easy,: null
    and trying to supervisor him with that and everything and, uh, playing squirt guns and all that,: null
    and we still have a scrap every now and then.: null
    and we went over to, uh, lady that breeds them here in town: null
    and, I, I just, you know, I just don't.: null
    and, and now they've lost the desire.: null
    and, and she doesn't go far: null
    and, th, we've tried to get her to like other cats: null
    and, uh, I play, uh, with the three year old: null
    and, uh, her daughter actually was,: null
    and, uh, they go, like to go skiing,: null
    and, was a, a problem with having five children needing to work a, a fulltime job that,: null
    another thing we used to do is have ham, family councils.: null
    as a matter of fact, that's what we're doing tonight .: null
    as a mother I will have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have: null
    as far as during the week, it's, it's usually, just my son and I,: null
    as far as our activities, we are kind of on a different level here.: null
    as far as that , that's about all we've discussed as far as for family.: null
    as far as that goes, we play games,: null
    as is our husband,: null
    as the kids got older I made them, help me cut the grass and: null
    as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things,: null
    as they were growing up much of, our, normal life outside of school and everything arou, revolved around their swimming.: null
    as, when they were growing up, I, probably we had a lot of similar things l, like you had, having the time.: null
    at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth.: null
    at any rate, my first two children, I didn't spend a whole lot of time with them.: null
    at least for a year and a half: null
    at least once you pay your way in there,: null
    at the end you had a decorated tree.: null
    at this particular time the children were two and six.: null
    at work a lot of people are,: null
    band and, and, scouts were his two big things.: null
    be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without: null
    because, uh, when he was a baby that we did the swimming too: null
    being from Plano, I know so very few people who have extended family in town.: null
    both my husband and I work: null
    both of mine are boys.: null
    both preschoolers,: null
    boy, I, I feel for you and your husband.: null
    boy, they, they'd show up.: null
    but I won't let them get,: null
    but I, I have a lot of friends with children: null
    but it took our total time.: null
    but my cats are insi,: null
    but she just wants to be able to have that freedom.: null
    but she's married,: null
    but they're all mongrels .: null
    but what they don't have is you.: null
    but, of course, uh, Richardson is in the Dallas area.: null
    but, uh, they put up with each other: null
    but, uh, this last ski trip they took, uh, she had in, contracted chicken pox first: null
    children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now.: null
    come about this time of year I am kind of ready for it to start getting spring,: null
    communications.: null
    course, when our big ones were little, we lived up north,: null
    course, when they got bigger, they were both quite into sports: null
    cousins and aunts and uncles,: null
    did some shopping and stuff.: null
    drugs is, in Texas, are extremely bad.: null
    during the day, it's all devoted to our kids: null
    entirely too much time is spent,: null
    ? even if our kids, get into sports that we're really not interested in, I don't,
      I want them, to know that we're still there
    : null
    even just this first year, that I've been with, my son, h, here, he's,: null
    even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot.: null
    even just when I grew up and everything.: null
    even now with my grandchildren, I feel it's a very important thing to be done.: null
    even the, the older kids sometimes sit down and, and will join in and listen to a story.: null
    ? even though the kids are basically, grown, they still like to sit down at the
      table and us all eat together when they're here and
    : null
    even, even when I was, when I was, living with her with did stuff then too,: null
    every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the,: null
    every now and then, he's got a lot of those technic, those hard kind,: null
    every time something new came up, I was explaining it to them.: null
    every weekend there was some visiting somewhere.: null
    every year I'd have the Lego train under the tree.: null
    everybody tends to be in the same boat.: null
    everybody's neutered: null
    everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled.: null
    everyone would get one vote.: null
    ? everything that he taught me, that my family taught me, which is very hard to
      change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say, I'm sorry,
    : null
    everything's free except for the food.: null
    except that I consider them my children .: null
    first of all, uh, the girls joined,: null
    first thing I did was turn the TV on.: null
    five are, four of them are grown,: null
    for just, for just a day, not in, a day or two, not including lodging and food and all that.: null
    for my older boy that was in college I put a dollar bill for each day. Which was the equivalent: null
    for one thing.: null
    for right now, they don't,: null
    for them that's wonderful,: null
    ? four, fou, four children is expensive, especially when you consider especially
      for me, which I'm paying out of state tuition.
    : null
    from little on,: null
    from talking to them, they're shocked.: null
    from the people I've talked to, I don't know if I should bring this into it,: null
    fuzzy little thing.: null
    granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it,: null
    have Christmas dinner with us and then go to other inlaws and things,: null
    he and his wife come and a lot of their friends,: null
    he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family,: null
    he could buy us material things.: null
    he did get on the bus,: null
    he gets home from work late or whatever: null
    he has an apartment,: null
    he has to work almost every Saturday: null
    he has traveled: null
    he has, he has seven other brothers and sisters,: null
    he held three jobs. was in college * Could this be "while he . . ."?: null
    he is in the Navy.: null
    he just didn't make that kind of money with five children.: null
    he made it at fifty .: null
    ? he never ever thought of, not going to school he said, in view of the fact that
      he was certain I had a hot line to his school.
    : null
    he plays tennis with, with the kids.: null
    he put himself through college,: null
    he reads to them,: null
    he really enjoys it.: null
    he really likes that.: null
    he sat down,: null
    he spends a lot of time with them while I'm cooking: null
    he spends about an hour doing that,: null
    he spends time doing that with him, planning and, practicing outside.: null
    he still likes: null
    he still works part time at other thing, same job as he was doing, only he's retired and doing it independently.: null
    he wants me now,: null
    he wants to be an engineer,: null
    he wants to be best friends: null
    he was coming home: null
    he was from the time he was in the seventh grade and, a small and all the way through college: null
    he was just so bad off,: null
    he was off today, looking at, at records.: null
    he was treated like he had five fathers or something.: null
    he went at fifty,: null
    he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat,: null
    he worked on that for the longest time, ever since school was out on Friday,: null
    he works four days on: null
    he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of, of, lines. So that,: null
    he would leave,: null
    he'll, he'll take them out just to be with them.: null
    he's a real sports kind of person,: null
    he's a record collector and a Hot Wheels collector.: null
    he's been retired for three years now.: null
    he's going to be with, regular pitching: null
    he's gone three weeks right now: null
    he's got a second job.: null
    he's in kindergarten,: null
    he's into wrestling.: null
    he's like a little brother to me.: null

    he's thirtyseven: null
    he's, he's not home very often.: null
    he, he manages a plant out here,: null
    he, he worked a fulltime job and a parttime job,: null
    he, he works about an hour and a half away from here, from our home,: null
    he, he works for Coca Cola.: null
    he, he's fun.: null
    he, he, he wants to be best friends now: null
    he, she said that her husband said to her daughter, you need a hobby,: null
    he, they can have time with him an.: null
    he, they, the school district hires an aide, to work: null
    he, when he comes home, he, He puts the kids to bed,: null
    he, works, for a different company.: null
    her husband builds forte pianos,: null
    his dad's at home: null
    his parents have thirteen grandchildren.: null
    his, what he does is, when he gets home, he separates his work from his house.: null
    history is what their peace class is this year.: null
    hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home.: null
    hopefully, hopefully it's going to spread, .: null
    if I have something in mind, then he, he remembers that,: null
    if he flunked out he was on his own ...: null
    if he got married he was on his own,: null
    if my Dad had done that when I was a kid I probably wouldn't have liked it.: null
    if they start going in the front and stuff, I bring them in.: null
    if they want to play, they have to play with mom and dad.: null
    if we do watch T V at night, they just enjoy just, laying on top of me or something.: null
    if you go back there, then you can never get out.: null
    if, if everybody would be a little bit responsible,: null
    if, if they missed it, they had to abide by the rules.: null
    if, if we want to drive, we pay our own insurance,: null
    in fact my mom's out there in Texas right now, in Dallas, spending a month with her cousins, on their ranch,: null
    in fact, I found that I'm a lot closer with,: null
    in fact, I'll be leaving very shortly to go to work: null
    in order to have a reason for being there, especially as they got older, I became involved in it too: null
    in that case then I'll be, I'll be at home when my children are at home,: null
    in the Dallas area: null
    in the beginning when he, he was transferred to a, a larger plant: null
    in the next year or so, you'll see so many instances where, he'll mimic something that you've done,: null
    in the summer everyone is I think there's seven of us still at home,: null
    in the summer we spent most weekends on the lake with them skiing: null
    in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books: null
    in the winter when it wa,: null
    it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it: null
    it costs two hundred dollars for books,: null
    it didn't cost any money.: null
    it doesn't matter what age you have,: null
    it finally got motheaten,: null
    it has a bunch of different rides for kids.: null
    ? it has, helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise
      that I think are wonderful particularly at this age,
    : null
    it is a program for: null
    it is hard to make, those interests not be as a major part of my life.: null
    it is too early yet.: null
    it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little.: null
    it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her. Which is kind of sad,: null
    it keeps them busy.: null
    it makes me sick,: null
    it never worked that way.: null
    it really helped when the, older one was old enough to get his license and could,: null
    it seems like he is suppose to come home for three or four days,: null
    it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball.: null
    it seems that now the bank's not available.: null
    it seems, it seems for them that it works out all right.: null
    it takes a lot of time.: null
    it takes him a little bit of time.: null
    it varies what it is, of course,: null
    it was a Christmas tree that had, a little trinket for each day,: null
    it was a matter of somebody had to have a job.: null
    it was a really neat experience,: null
    it was about a year or so ago, when we went.: null
    it was an hour,: null
    it was easier for them to do that,: null
    it was funny,: null
    it was his responsibility: null
    it was sort of an Italian family,: null
    it was time for them to go to bed.: null
    it was with all of them,: null
    it was, I guess I didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time.: null
    it was, it was, it was fun,: null
    it was, more an impact, I think, on the oldest two.: null
    it wasn't that I didn't like them: null
    it worked out fine from that standpoint, plus the fact that, when I left,: null
    it would, I think it was very beneficial to us.: null
    it's a game that none of their friends know how to play,: null
    it's a girl.: null
    it's a indoor fun park: null
    it's a little bit past Campbell and Plano Road .: null
    it's a real, it's a real problem for me.: null
    it's a, it's a whole different, kind of thing there then,: null
    it's almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children,: null
    it's also important, I think, for my husband.: null
    it's always the same man: null
    it's been an interesting, roughly, nine months here,: null
    it's between tennis and, and bowling.: null
    it's called a sleep book: null
    it's changed over the, over the years,: null
    it's coach pitch, until you get nine: null
    it's during the week,: null
    it's five dollars admission per child, all day.: null
    it's football in the fall and, and baseball in the spring: null
    it's funny because, my mom and dad both were kind of athletic.: null
    it's hard for him on Saturdays.: null
    it's just really nice because we can do, the things you want to do.: null
    ? it's just, it's helps, I think, the children to, when they're learning in school,
      to say, I've been there and I've seen that.
    : null
    it's kind of hard for us to visit with them, as much as I'd like to.: null
    it's kind of hard.: null
    it's kind of like they don't,: null
    it's like in Richardson you go up Plano Road,: null
    it's like you grow up to be twenty years old,: null
    it's like, I can only express myself so much,: null
    it's like, do I really need to work,: null
    it's more fun with four people.: null
    it's not really just to getting to sight see.: null
    it's not that constant: null
    it's our last hope .: null
    it's really fun.: null
    it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something,: null
    it's really pretty funny to see my parents get into it,: null
    it's straight: null
    it's that grandmother figure, not only raising her own children, but raising, children from the streets, too, frequently.: null
    it's very hard for me: null
    it's we never threw a football or something: null
    it's working out pretty well.: null
    it's, I really think it's true for our family,: null
    it's, although it's not the same, we are,: null
    it's, because like this one that lives right next door, her mother does some work at home: null
    it's, it's a beautiful city.: null
    it's, it's certainly not at all common,: null
    ? it's, it's in the same old y, routine of, doing homework and, trying to talk
      between all of that and, and, the other activities that we all have.
    : null
    it's, it's so different down here where y, you go take lessons to learn to ice skate or something.: null
    it's, it's, it's real easy to work out my schedule,: null
    it's, it's, it's, it's been difficult to try to find the time,: null
    it's, it's, ten o'clock here in Falls Church, Virginia.: null
    it's, it's, we can see it work with her,: null
    it's, there's a lot of kids in the family: null
    it, it all paid off.: null
    it, it just seems like there was always something to do.: null
    it, it's a little bit difficult, though.: null
    it, it's funny,: null
    it, it's really hard.: null
    just by touching a nose to another cat they can contac, leukemia, feline leukemia,: null
    just getting out in the front, and just being outside is good for them: null
    just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning, you can stay up: null
    just so that they get to know their grandparents, but also for help .: null
    just start not even,: null
    just the time that they were spending together,: null
    just to let you know, I have, two, children of my own.: null
    keep it off of here .: null
    kind of the same thing, our,: null
    last night was a band concert: null
    last week we got a lot.: null
    last year they, they, got, the state level.: null
    last, a few summers ago I kept two children every day for the entire summer: null
    let me see, I've got two children.: null
    like I sa, I don't have any children.: null
    like I said my wife normally feels that way,: null
    like I say, I'm twenty, I'll be twentytwo next month,: null
    like in my case I, I do shift work.: null
    like last weekend, there's the Soviet space exhibit is here in Dallas,: null
    lot of time spent with her,: null
    m, my sister that's closest to me, we're only fourteen months apart.: null
    maybe after we decide to have kids I, I might find a job that has flexible hours.: null
    ? maybe just even, if we just rent a movie and watch it together just to make
      sure that everybody's not going out and doing and their her own thing all the
      time.
    : null
    maybe that riding place that is North of town that she goes to.: null
    ? maybe they just decided that, if they wanted to have kids around the house they
      would just call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the
      kids over for the night.
    : null
    mine I don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here.: null
    mine are all grown .: null
    mine is, down at U T Austin at college: null
    mine were not terribly sporting.: null
    most of them are going and seeing Grandma and Grandpa.: null

    my husband, is working mo, most of the time.: null

    now, my wife and I both work: null
    now, this weekend we'll have a babysitter come: null

    one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek,: null
    one of the biggest complaints I well remember because I spent a lot of time with seniors,: null
    ? one of the things I've noticed is, one of the trends I've, I've noticed is that,
      it's always too easy to just plop your kids down in front of the T V and let
      them watch movies or, or play video games or something.

    that is, that's, the, the, my little pair.: null
    that just kind of works out real well.: null
    that kind of covers it.: null
    that leaves me off on holidays and summers.: null
    that really gets kind of aggravating after a while: null
    that the only reason I'm home is because I'm home with a cold .: null
    that was a cat that hit the telephone.: null
    that was a lot of fun.: null
    that was always good time.: null
    that was it,: null
    that was nice: null
    that was the most boring place on earth.: null
    ? that was the thing that I, I noticed that, I know a lot of people, lot of friends
      that we have, they have a tendency to do the same thing.
    : null
    that's a lot of fun.: null
    that's a tradition: null
    that's a, that's a neat thing.: null
    that's about all I can think to talk about right now.: null
    that's about it.: null
    that's all you can do.: null
    that's always been a little bit of a tradition that we've had.: null
    that's an opportunity to get out the games: null

    that's because of religious values as well.: null
    that's his mother: null
    that's how I keep looking at it.: null
    that's how we spent most of the time with him.: null
    that's kind of a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son,: null
    that's kind of cutting into your, your time.: null
    that's one reason I have so many because I really, I enjoy the big family.: null
    that's right.: null
    that's so true.: null
    that's something we spend time together too, is, cooking and, preparing meals and stuff.: null

    that's what I was doing before,: null
    that's what was kind of what, where we were,: null
    that's what, when she's with me that's what we do.: null
    that's where they've gone to make their homes.: null
    that's why they're over there.: null
    that's, I think,: null
    that's, that's mild compare to the big ones,: null
    that's, that's pretty good quality time,: null
    that's, that's real neat.: null
    that's, that's what happened to my brother.: null
    that, it's kind of a seasonal thing.: null
    that, that got me to sp, to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff,: null
    that, that was always good quality time for us.: null
    the Navy is sending him for his Masters in Ocean Engineering: null

    the rest of the time she's free.: null
    the school years are wonderful,: null
    the second question, forgot what the second question,: null
    the thing that sticks out most in my mind is that, a kid's place area.: null

    the time that my, we spent with our Dad was, he owned his own business: null
    the topic for me,: null

    the, the boys tried those,: null
    the, the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around: null
    the, the mom stayed home, and raised the kids.: null
    ? the, the one down thing about having that many people in our family is you real,

    ? then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling, like
      do you want to home school your kids on a computer program
    : null
    then we kick the ball.: null
    then we, when we all graduated from hi, college, from high school,: null
    then what my father did was, was, in, obvious to me: null
    then you took it off and put it on the tree,: null
    then, a family is, is definitely a high priority.: null
    then, my husband enjoys spending time with the kids,: null

    when they felt like it, they went out to play,: null
    when they go, it's on business: null
    when they were little, we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks,: null
    when they were very young I did not work.: null
    when was, when she was here last summer we played tennis: null

      capitol and, and things like that when they were small.

    with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way: null

    yet she'd get to spend, three or four days with ...: null
    yet, on the other hand, I, I've got the mixed feelings that I think you should be at home with your children.: null
    you always have the lack of funds: null
    you are welcome to keep that .: null
    you buy a present,: null
    you don't have any money to, to, get out.: null
    you don't see many leaves around Dallas.: null

    you get to stay home,: null
    you have got,: null
    you honestly do.: null
    you know, if I could have, I would have.: null
    you probably know a peace group that, that they are advanced type. That they are special, classes for peace classes.: null
    you said, you said you worked a couple days a month, though,: null
    you think, if I wasn't here he'd be learning that from a babysitter or from a day care.: null
    ? you want to be avail, I've wanted to be available, when they, for some reason,
      they had, they were bouncing something off of me.
    : null
    you were saying what other trends are there,: null
    you wrap the present up,: null
    you'd have to pay air fare,: null
    you're saying, I work full time too,: null
    you, it's, it's hard sometimes at work because, people say, we're taking a cruise,: null
    your holidays are, too.: null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    A lot more available, of course.: null
    A lot of people choose to, which is fine.: null
    A lot of times the parents get into it just as much as, as the kids,: null
    And I guess it's not really soccer it's just kind of a, well, kick the ball around for a while,: null
    And I think, uh, the big city, uh,: null
    And it seems like it's more, uh,: null
    And it was really neat because they all were interested in each other and, and the cats: null
    ? And, and it seems like it's a lot more than the, they need to know and be able
      to do than when we are the, when I had to go in t, ki, kindergarten.
    : null
    And, and, the way it is now you get a lot of supervision is, is at hand and everything.: null
    And, uh, and that was, that was more fun to watch those boys trying to, trying to kick the ball up and down the field.: null
    And, uh, it seems like it's,: null
    And, uh, you know,: null
    And, uh, you know, I find it's, it's quite a bit different now: null
    ? And, uh, you know, it tends to, uh, to encourage students to not be as, you
      know, to not concentrate as much on the education.
    : null
    And, you know, to, to see how little they can get by with.: null
    As long as you do not have to drive in it.: null
    As long as you make her feel, uh, like she's still loved and everything,: null
    Away from a road, you know, and you keep an eye on her, it's probably okay.: null
    Basically, I think they, they really spoil the child,: null
    But how these women must feel to place their children into care: null
    But, uh, I guess the activities that, uh, we have with them are, uh, pretty few and far between.: null
    Children are so full of energy.: null
    Day cares have, have, have popped up and become a lot more, a lot bigger part of, of the kids' lives.: null
    Especially in some of these schools around here, I think they have about twenty percent older students.: null
    Especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner.: null
    Every person out there should have kids, at least once or, or have some they can borrow for a time,: null
    Fathers don't even like malls,: null
    Give them, give them an edge,: null
    Got a parttime job: null
    He, her nose will be out of joint for a while: null
    However, there are, there are, points both directions in that, from the standpoint of parents working and not working.: null
    I am sure it was,: null
    I am surprised they would bring anything over here.: null
    I believe that, we in that category,: null
    I can't imagine th, them having as much fun as the parents,: null
    I d, I also think that's, at least in my experience, truer of girls than boys.: null
    I decided that, you need that once in awhile. That you, you need to plan the quality time: null
    I do feel like it's important that you make the time for children ,: null
    I do think it's right that they're harder on themselves,: null
    I do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twentyfour hours a day.: null
    I do think that the parents should have, a little bit more time to spend with their kids.: null
    I do think with working parents it is, there are some real issues here.: null
    I do think, the current trends are that, the family unit is devaluated.: null
    ? I don't know what the families are going to come to now days because they, there
      just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids.
    : null
    ? I don't quite understand it, although I think probably the, the worst thing
      that's happening in the world, at least the modern world today, is television.
    : null
    I don't see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that.: null
    I don't think it needs to be the mothers,: null
    I don't think it's going to be realistic.: null
    I don't think it's too good.: null
    I don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some.: null
    I don't think they're leaving them with babysitters,: null
    I don't think you, you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of, of losing your fam, the family unit.: null
    I don't think, although i, i,: null
    I feel much the same way.: null
    I feel really bad that it's turned so much: null
    I guarantee it.: null
    I guess I'm too protective,: null
    I guess it's why they wanted to do it on this type of telephone because there's all kind of activity that goes on.: null
    ? I guess one of the things that I think about is a, talking about education,
      uh, I kind of feel like, uh, that, uh, the, the school systems in this, particularly
      in this area, the systems are not under enough control.
    : null
    I guess that was good that you were, you were hearing it from other students.: null
    I guess that's not a big surprise.: null
    I guess they get used to it.: null
    ? I guess, that was, you know, as important, uh, as much important to the parents
      as it was to the children that, uh, you know, to get out and watch the kids
      play,
    : null
    I know that it, it must be really challenging to, try to juggle a job and, and also your children.: null
    ? I mea, I imagine with infants you are, most of your time is sort of spent taking
      care of them rather than interacting with them.
    : null
    I most certainly couldn't educate three.: null
    I really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children: null
    I really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that, we need to do something about,: null
    ? I thin, there's also some, I think, poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply
      because it dominates so much discussionary time.
    : null
    I think I think people are trying to get out of that.: null
    I think I would be extremely jealous, or would have been, had there been another child in the family.: null
    I think a lot of families now, they probably don't spend enough time together.: null
    ? I think a lot of people are panicked, how kids are turning out and how things
      are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something.
    : null
    I think a lot of people are, are turning to, I think, I think a lot of people are realizing that: null
    I think a lot of people either, don't care, or don't realize it,: null
    I think a, a, more than one child, probably three children is probably the ideal to me: null
    I think different parts of the country,: null
    I think if we weren't so interested i, in children, in child care, then we wouldn't be teaching anyway.: null
    ? I think in Plano and maybe this area in Texas, there's a lot of community activities
      that parents could join in with their kids.
    : null
    I think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours.: null
    I think it's a big, it's a big, responsibility.: null
    I think it's a step, a, a giant step of progress, I really do.: null
    I think it's an investment in your future, even if it's purely not, not religious.: null
    I think it's excellent because she's getting qualified quality time: null
    I think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction: null
    I think it's improving, actually.: null
    I think it's,: null
    I think it, it really, it really helped to have that time together.: null
    I think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now.: null
    I think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff, stuff like that.: null
    I think parents are definitely, spending more and more time.: null
    I think she planned it.: null
    ? I think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now
      is because the basic family unit is being destroyed.
    : null
    I think that was better than Showbiz Pizza cause there's more for them to do.: null
    I think that was really ideal,: null
    I think that would be the ideal situation.: null
    I think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication: null
    I think that's for the, the few and far between.: null
    I think that's just part of their overall educational process, is to get out and see and do things.: null
    I think that's le, tended to lead to a decline in, in families and family values especially.: null
    I think that's probably true. The,: null
    I think that's probably what it was.: null
    I think that's really the best.: null
    I think that's that is a big problem. The television: null
    I think that's wonderful.: null
    I think that, most, most kids that I see don't really, they don't really value quality time.: null
    I think that, probably ninety percent of the,: null
    I think that, we need to spend more family time together with, with children today.: null
    I think the trend in the United States,: null
    I think they can turn off the T V for one thing.: null
    I think they just learn to accept.: null
    I think they've learned a whole lot about being part of a team, whether the team is your singing group, your band, your: null
    I think this is not a normal situation anymore in our, in our world we live in.: null
    I think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now.: null
    I think we make a point to do that.: null
    I think with the way the future is, economy wise,: null
    ? I think with working moms, if you can get them ma, the bosses to give you almost
      a rotation like they're going to do with yearround school where you work,
    : null
    I think you'll see a lot of growth in, in their ability to, control their thought pattern: null
    I think you're doing a good job.: null
    I think yu, you grow closer.: null
    I think, I think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was there: null
    I think, it's very, very easy to fall into that trap,: null
    I think, it, they need you in different ways.: null
    ? I think, like in my situation, today, on a weekend when couples are supposed
      to spend time together, my husband's been off doing his thing all day today,
    : null
    I think, the kids are where they need to,: null
    I think, the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools,: null
    I think, the older mine get, the more I enjoy them.: null
    ? I think, think that's another reason why people are, so health conscious now
      is because America's becoming really a couch potato society.
    : null
    ? I think, those type of children, that are involved in things like that, their,
      goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating
      in things.
    : null
    I think, uh, you know, some of the thing has to do with, uh,: null
    I thought to myself, how can a mother place her child at the age of six weeks or four weeks or two weeks or three weeks,: null
    I would think for your parents it would be, it would still be hard even nowadays, just to raise twelve kids.: null
    I'd have to go in the other: null
    I'm going to have difficulty with this topic.: null
    I'm not sure I could afford three.: null
    I'm not, totally innocent of that because,: null
    I'm sure it does.: null
    I'm sure it has been done.: null
    I'm sure part of it is a male, female thing,: null
    I'm sure she is.: null
    I'm sure when your children grew up you didn't,: null
    I've heard very positive things about Atlanta,: null
    I, I don't think they'd like to.: null
    I, I don't, I don't really see that, that trend changing much,: null
    I, I feel like, uh,: null
    I, I it seems like that's, that's a big trend, in the last ten years.: null
    I, I personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child, for the,: null
    I, I think a lot of people, a lot of people s, set their kids in front of the T V and H B O and rent movies and, and,: null
    I, I think he said that he'd give her a big ring and she got married to him.: null
    I, I think it's gotten, very different.: null
    I, I think kids now a days are raised on T V.: null
    I, I think so, too.: null
    I, I think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together.: null
    I, I think the trends are going back to spending more time with families.: null
    I, I think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home, very early to come to grips with any guilt,: null
    I, I think, I think that would be the ideal situation,: null
    I, I would probably have a hard time getting through school myself.: null
    I, I'm sure there's a lot of differences in the way, in the way it's done now and then.: null
    I, I, I think that my wife leaned that way: null
    I, I, I think that, I think very few spend quality time.: null
    I, ideally, it wo, it would be nice to be able to just have, back in the old days,: null
    If it's not raining.: null
    If we were careless and was in a wreck and they got sued: null
    If you like doing everything twice .: null
    If you're, stay at home and you're a mother, it's what a waste.: null
    If, if a woman is happy doing that,: null
    In fact in, I think if people would learn to turn off the T V s: null
    In fact, I, I think things were, were quite a bit different.: null
    It makes you know that you can't take anything for granted: null
    It really is hard.: null
    It seems almost as though children hate it.: null
    It seems bizarre to me.: null
    It was a complete waste of money.: null
    It was much, much harder when mine were young.: null
    It's a little bit financial type thing: null
    It's a little bit of a ways,: null
    It's a lot more complicated.: null
    It's an adjustment to make, also.: null
    It's an interesting: null
    It's just different.: null
    It's like a home away from home for a lot of them.: null
    It's not to say that some day you won't go back to work.: null
    It's really kind of sad,: null
    It's so darned easy to turn the thing on.: null
    It's too much effort to go somewhere with all the kids.: null
    It's, it's amazing, they either have one or none.: null
    It's, it's better to be employed.: null
    It's, it's not easy.: null
    ? It's, it's really hard, hard to find time to spend together when you both work
      full time and, you both have hobbies that are different.
    : null
    It, in the middle of it, it seems like a long time,: null
    Just keep them talking that way.: null
    Just simply because that time isn't spent just doing things like fishing: null
    Kids, I think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway.: null
    Let's face it,: null
    Maybe, maybe you will get lucky and get a girl this time.: null
    Most of them, continue to work if they have, have kids.: null
    Not for kids .: null
    Not necessarily in that order,: null
    Not so much because, it's bad per se, although there is some pretty crappy programming: null
    Not that the civil rights program is bad: null
    Now I think: null
    Parents kind of went and did their thing,: null
    People are,: null
    People do it for their children ,: null
    Seems like it went through a spell there where families weren't that big a deal.: null
    So, it's, it's always nice to see people that like each other,: null
    Sounds like you're, have a handle on it.: null
    Television sure makes child rearing easy on you.: null
    That becomes a drudgery: null
    That is a lot of money.: null
    That is awful high.: null
    That keeps you bu,: null
    That ki, the kids maybe on the average get, something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents.: null
    That's a lot of time.: null
    That's also something, family oriented that everyone can do.: null
    That's good to hear.: null
    That's good, you know,: null
    That's great fun .: null
    That's quite a change.: null
    That's really is: null
    That's true,: null
    That, uh, uh, watching a little, little boys play soccer is, is more fun.: null
    The best of,: null
    The make it worth it, with the cost of daycare.: null
    The only problem is, it keeps you pretty busy, keeping everything going,: null
    The time you have with them has to be quality time then.: null
    The, the students have a little too much, uh, too much leeway.: null
    The, uh, there i, there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum.: null
    Then your kind family is probably pretty rare now a days.: null
    There's no question,: null
    There, there, there is a difference there.: null
    They do what they see,: null
    They learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure.: null
    They need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what's,: null
    They really grow up quick. Especially at that early age.: null
    They'll always remember it, too.: null
    They're always wanting to go on a diet or something.: null
    They're expecting more or, uh, or just, uh, you know,: null
    They're probably at an age where they don't want to spend any time with their parents.: null
    They're really nice looking cats.: null
    Things are very different nowadays than when I grew up: null
    Time spent with Mom and Dad is, next, is probably one of the worst punishments spent on earth to them.: null
    Uh, I guess, uh, what I see is so far as, uh, the trends, uh, uh, for children, uh,: null
    ? Uh, the only other thing I have noticed though is that, uh, it seems that there's
      been a lot of or more empha, emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with
    : null
    Uh, uh, I kind of feel like there's, there's too much allowed to go on in at, at school.: null
    Um, an, an, and the, and that's kind of contradictory to what I said: null
    Until, until they're older: null
    Utah's a lot better than Texas.: null
    ? Wayne, I, feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children,
      and making time available even sometimes when time isn't available.
    : null
    We don't even have to cook dinner anymore.: null
    We don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning .: null
    ? We find that, back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems,
      the first place they went to was their family.
    : null
    We know what we can do .: null
    We're past, we're past that age .: null
    Well I'm sure it's been done.: null
    Well, that's, that's a little unusual for, uh, for children of that age, to have both of them that age at home.: null
    When you have children, you have to say, now, this is different: null
    When you have younger ones to take care of, you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones.: null
    When, when your own children are growing up, you just take them for granted: null
    Which is good, you know.: null
    Would be, shoosh.: null
    You can at least say that it's important to our country,: null
    You do the best you can: null
    You don't have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles.: null
    ? You don't necessarily have to be doing anything, that costs money or, or, that
      requires you to go a great distance or anything like that.
    : null
    You don't see yourself getting.: null
    You have to be a very unselfish person to, to spend a lot of time with your kids, I think.: null
    You have to look on that, on the, positive side of that.: null
    You just don't,: null
    You know, it must be hard when you have a lot of children,: null
    You know, they really don't have any choice .: null
    You know, they're, they're there for a good time.: null
    You of course, spend less time with them when they get older,: null
    You sound so young.: null
    You want to be around for the crisis and things like that,: null
    You're kind of like, what are you talking about: null
    You've still have a lot of time before she gets up in years .: null
    a family without a father, it's, it's, a really hard thing.: null
    a girl is very different .: null
    a girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping .: null
    a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs.: null
    a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead,: null
    a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that.: null
    a lot of the problem is to, you know,: null
    a lot of them decide just not to have children.: null
    a mother isn't an important: null
    and I seem, I seem to feel the same way, you know,: null
    and I think it's neat.: null
    and I, I'm not quite sure why.: null
    and he seems to enjoy it.: null
    and it's, it's just real tough on animals here, you know.: null
    and like families that get along with each other and like to do things together.: null
    and she'll hiss and growl and slap every now and then,: null
    and so they don't settle the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as, as, as,: null
    and the broken families.: null
    and they are lovely: null
    and, uh, and I think it's important because I think that, uh, you know, it gives him the interaction with the computer: null
    at least you're encouraging them on and stuff: null
    at least, I, I just consider myself blessed that I can stay home .: null
    ? because if, kids don't look up to you, or, or, ca, can't feel they can spend
      time with you, they're going to find someone else
    : null
    because it sure looks like that's going to be you, you know, the big thing for a long time.: null
    because that I think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot.: null
    between a person's religion, their, their faith in their maker: null
    both boy things .: null
    breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway,: null
    but I think she planned it .: null
    but anyway, we kind of got off the subject of children,: null
    but it seems to be getting worse and worse: null
    but she'll accept another cat eventually.: null
    but there's so much, uh, potential danger, you know,: null
    but they'll, she'll finally accept it.: null
    but when they're in school they, they don't have quite, quite as much control,: null
    definitely motherhood is devalued in this s, society.: null
    especially if they're active kids.: null
    especially when they get into the teenage stage.: null
    everybody else works: null
    everybody's not FATHER KNOWS BEST.: null
    everyone makes its own model,: null
    everything I'm doing, he's learning from.: null
    families are facing a challenge,: null
    families took care of themselves: null
    financially, they got themselves into I'll have the boat,: null
    first of all you're coming to me: null
    first, they always say, get to know your country first before you leave,: null
    friends are cool, parents aren't.: null
    girls at that age,: null
    house payment .: null
    how can you watch that,: null
    how easy it is to blow money you earn.: null
    i, it seems that there should be some continuity,: null
    if anything, I think,: null
    if she looks,: null
    if they force them to,: null
    if we were in a wreck, you can be sued for anything now.: null
    ? if you do have any time, it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to
      get so many other things done, ju, just to maintain your home and maintain the
      things outside your home and then, plus try to have that relationship with your
      children,
    : null
    if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that, that also helps.: null
    if you have a large number of children or, then you don't.: null
    if you have hobbies that are the same, then, you can enjoy your hobby together,: null
    if you have one child or fewer, you get involved in organized events or: null
    ? if you look all over in the other countries, like Europe and that, their standards
      of living are a lot less than what ours are
    : null
    if you want to do something every night that's fine,: null
    if you want to play something on the little kids' level, then the older kids get real bored,: null
    if you're kind of a person that likes things, organized or neat: null
    if, you know, it's not, it's just a temporary thing.: null
    ? in this modern day and age, it seems like, we have more and more leisure time
      because, we have so many convenience, appliances and whatnot.
    : null
    it carried over,: null
    ? it certainly does, because, the things in the books seem so dead to the kids,
      unless they've actually been there or whatever,
    : null
    it does begin with the families at home: null
    it gets hard, especially with the cars.: null
    ? it has been, it's been interesting and particularly I, I think because the society
      in which we live, families are separated.
    : null
    it is fun really.: null
    it is hard to do,: null
    it is hard, once they get that age,: null
    it is now, our financial situations are as, it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now: null
    it makes it a little bit easier, I think, that way.: null
    it must be tough.: null
    it puts a strain on everybody, your wife and your family.: null
    it really does: null
    ? it seems that business wise, in the business community, your employers seem
      to be taking more and more time away from the family.
    : null
    it sounds like we both have colds.: null
    it was bad enough every place else,: null
    it was making the friends and going all the places: null
    it was really sad, jus, that a lot of families, have to, have to have dual income.: null
    it's a rite of passage .: null
    it's a tough one.: null
    it's also for you, because you're both kind of bonding together there too, I think,: null
    it's always that way unti, until it's too late.: null
    it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child.: null
    it's becoming really health conscious: null
    it's been very well done .: null
    it's different staying home too,: null
    it's difficult,: null
    it's difficult, to do it any other way.: null
    it's funny,: null
    it's hard to make it on one income,: null
    it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the, they're the pivot point of the universe.: null
    it's helpful to have, things that become family traditions, and that sort of thing.: null
    ? it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to
      learn, that, that they need to learn at the age,
    : null
    it's just a different,: null
    it's just, if there were more than one child, I don't know, the, there would be no way to do it.: null
    it's like sticking, an electrode into their pleasure center: null
    it's like, if you plan a year ahead, you can probably save up seven hundred dollars: null
    it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow: null
    it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make,: null
    it's not just for him,: null
    it's not your kids' problems: null
    it's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing,: null
    it's our society saying yes,: null
    it's pretty hard: null
    it's really hard.: null
    it's really nice,: null
    it's really rough.: null
    it's so expensive, man.: null
    it's so, it would be really hard now to have twelve children.: null
    it's something that you can do: null
    it's the same type of thing,: null
    it's too late then,: null
    it's very hard to, spend time with the children and, and your husband and: null
    it's what's happening in the families.: null
    it's, it's hard because,: null
    it's, it's just not, it's not as stable for the kids,: null
    it's, it's too static,: null
    it's, it's very hard, because when you get used to two salaries, it's very hard to, to cut back to one.: null
    it's, it's very nice.: null
    it's, of course, still really important.: null
    it, it is hard, I can imagine, on your parents, ...: null
    it, it is interesting,: null
    it, it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours: null
    it, it's interesting.: null
    it, it's sometimes a very, it, it's a very hard juggling act.: null
    kids did their thing.: null
    kids eat funny.: null
    ? kids just because of the computer age or whatever, it just, know more when they
      get, you know, to be five or six or something.
    : null
    kind of goes on.: null
    let's see how we can get rid of the problem,: null
    ? like my husband was saying, maybe some of the problems we brought on to ourselves
      is that these women back in the nineteen fifties, were staying at home with
      their kids and then made the decision, jeez, I'll go out and get a parttime
      job.
    : null
    ? like what you said with the cost of living and everything, I think a lot of
      people can't afford to get by on just one salary an
    : null
    little girls are worse about it than little boys.: null
    m, I think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children: null
    maybe something will open up for you.: null
    none of us are.: null
    not a, not a very good one at that.: null
    now, people don't, they don't: null
    nowadays if there are two parents to a family, the mother works just as hard as the father does,: null
    nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid to, emulating or whatever.: null
    occasionally they do,: null
    ? of course, JudeoChristianity, and of the Jewish folks, too, believe that the
      family unit is the one that was given the, mission by the Lord
    : null
    of course, the competing itself, really didn't matter what it was,: null
    oh, they're just gorgeous,: null
    once they hit ten or eleven or twelve, you've pretty much lost them .: null
    once you're best friends with your parents, then, I think everything go a lot better.: null
    one parent go one direction: null
    ooh, for a family, for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick.: null
    or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when I went to school.: null
    parents are a curse that they just have to live with.: null
    people aren't doing anything just sitting around, no thinking involved: null
    phone calls that's about, about it.: null
    plus, plus I think it becomes part of y, part of you too,: null
    pretty soon, you're at the limit where you've got to say okay, you've sacrificed for, so many years at home: null
    probably maybe that, that.: null
    reading is so good.: null
    real maternal .: null
    really women, past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too,: null
    really, I think, sometimes there's an advantage,: null
    schools are: null
    so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult, I would think.: null
    so she really doesn't even know what it is to be the only one.: null
    sometimes I think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though,: null
    sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent.: null
    still there are so many people that are, have their careers first: null
    teaching, I think is a, a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids.: null
    th, that's how they're developing their patterns.: null
    ? that I think has contributed much to, the delinquency that and the poor school
      results that we're having. that the students', parents have just not really
      taken enough interest in them from the very very beginning
    : null
    that age, of course, everything you do they're trying to learn to do,: null
    that creates family tensions.: null
    that cuts into our free time right there.: null
    that does make a big difference.: null
    that is just as valuable,: null
    that is the trend in a lot of, lower class areas, for the grandmothers to be raising the children.: null
    that is the way of getting attention.: null
    that it's, it's really a sad commentary on, uh, you know, a life in general,: null
    that makes it hard though for in terms of, family time with,: null
    that must be the thing.: null
    ? that people are starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying
      to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like
      that.
    : null
    that should be first and, and children second.: null
    that that's a tough situation,: null
    that worked out really well because it's a big transition I think to have children.: null
    that you really have to watch your children so closely now: null
    that's a big thrill for them.: null
    that's a good way to put it.: null
    that's a little tough for fathers.: null
    that's a possibility.: null
    that's a pretty good way to put it .: null
    that's a, a great career.: null
    that's for sure .: null
    that's good sometimes because you need to, get away.: null
    that's good, that's real good advice.: null
    that's it then, I think,: null
    that's kind of hard to do,: null
    that's part of, I think, teaching too, is what a family is like,: null
    that's plenty though.: null
    that's probably good,: null
    that's quite a spread .: null
    that's that's very, that's very hard to do,: null
    that's the kind of thing that they will remember, though.: null
    that's tough, you know ...: null
    that's true.: null
    that's, that's almost a surog,: null
    that's, that's good, too, as far as entering,: null
    that's, that's not as bad.: null
    that's, those are a long way.: null
    that, that certainly can happen now if: null
    that, that would be fun.: null
    that, that's, is an advantage of being in the education field.: null
    that, that, I guess you could consider that organized.: null
    that, they say it, it, all it takes is about five, ten minutes a day.: null
    that, uh, you know that children can't, cannot be allowed to grow up, uh, you know, without really close supervision.: null
    that, uh, you know, you have to watch your children so closely and, uh, keep up with them.: null
    the child needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something.: null
    the children stay at home and get into trouble: null
    the communication helps you build on your, helps just, just build your family.: null
    the cost of living here is just so tremendously, outrageous .: null
    the kids can be a real pest,: null
    ? the kids in some ways are, are, are suffering a little bit, in that, the model,
      the role models that get the, the, the family issues that get discussed,
    : null
    the little kids would have nothing.: null
    the one trend I would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers,: null
    the only thing you can remember is to try and stay together as much as you can,: null
    the trends in the families were to spread apart, do your own thing.: null
    the winter gets long.: null
    their Catholic *they're: null
    their friends are the most important thing there is.: null
    then I think it, it is hard.: null
    then the kids kind of suffer.: null
    then when you start having two of them, it's, a little bit tougher,: null
    then you never get to know them either.: null
    there is a competition all the time.: null
    there's a lot of emphasis on, on, on, on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten.: null
    there's just so many things to do with them nowadays, though,: null
    there's less, friction involved in relationships when you add that skill: null
    there's no thinking involved, no motion,: null
    there's not enough time,: null
    they can take everything away from my mom and dad,: null
    they despise shopping.: null
    they don't always do it,: null
    they don't have kind of an, what we call an internal perspective of things.: null
    they don't like it.: null
    they drop their kids off at daycare and, and leave them: null
    ? they expect us to, have, create miracles at school and fix all the problems
      and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers
    : null
    they get to that stage.: null
    they just really can't wait to be able to take their kids where they had fun.: null
    they keep you hopping, I'm sure.: null
    they learn from their friends,: null
    they look back.: null
    they need to really focus on the children in the wor, in this country.: null
    they think that's a family activity,: null
    they want to be able to spend,: null
    they want to do something else.: null
    they were, they just, the, they just keep you going .: null
    they're cute.: null
    they're good: null
    they're not use to being with adults and to responding: null
    they're stuck in a day care.: null
    they're very, very different,: null
    they're, they are more use to being with their own age kids: null
    they've got to keep them in line.: null
    they, they learn to share.: null
    they, they'd much rather be with friends,: null
    ? thing is, is, that, if, if they would ever happen to have a drug problem, suppose,
      that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying, I got a problem
    : null
    things cost a lot more.: null
    those are neat cats, too.: null
    those are the two that can, that, that have the wherewithal: null
    to go from, nothing,: null
    to some extent the public schools, or the schools in general,: null
    turning the T V on is almost like magic,: null
    usually people are not sitting in front of that.: null
    we are seasoned minds.: null
    we certainly, we need more of that,: null
    we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in: null
    we feel that, just spending time together.: null
    we kind of got different ball game: null
    we know what we're wanting to, to, study: null
    we need more parents willing to supervise,: null
    we see , we see all the time, the outcome of not doing that: null
    we seem to agree.: null
    we're, we're smarter now.: null
    we've had such a breakdown in the family structure,: null
    well I've been around a lot of people lately at wo, at my job that don't have a lot of values .: null
    well if you're off, off, of a, you know, away from a road,: null
    well those cats were great.: null
    what a coincidence.: null
    what if's always rough.: null
    what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids.: null
    ? whatever the employer says you have to be back at work is basically when you
      have to be back at work, whether it be six weeks or three or four.
    : null
    when another group of, of, people step in, try to do it, they're, they're tromping on our territory, so to speak,: null
    when they do, there's a reason for it, that they're sharing it,: null
    when they, when it's not there they miss it.: null
    when you adjust your income for what you put out for daycare, you're only making five.: null
    when you employ the Word of God there's nothing as powerful as the Word of God.: null
    when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore,: null
    when you're saying older, we're talking fifty up.: null
    whenever you're with your kids, you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them.: null
    where, where parents are spending less time, you don't have the families, too, to take up the gap.: null
    whether their parents are together or divorced they don't spend enough time together: null
    which the organization can use the help too.: null
    why not because that's a, a lot of times, it's,: null
    with kids you're not going to have a neat house.: null
    with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation.: null
    with them being as young.: null
    would, it would not have been a good idea to had them then.: null
    y, as you know, with five children it takes a lot of work.: null
    yet, you feel for the, the kids.: null
    ? you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults
      that, the ones that are, are home and the ones even that are at home that are
      getting the love and attention that they need.
    : null
    you can't afford to.: null
    you can't take this money with us, though: null
    you cannot,: null
    you do have to give things up.: null
    you don't have quite as much money when, when the wife doesn't work.: null
    you don't have to worry about them.: null
    you get to a point where it's completely impossible.: null
    you go ahead and do your thing: null
    you got to do what you got to do,: null
    you got to try to be with them as much as you can: null
    you have a lot of kids.: null
    you have to be under control so much when they're out: null
    you have to make that decision: null
    you have to make that decision to go back to work parttime or go back to work fulltime: null
    you have your hands full with them,: null
    you just felt, gee, if I weren't here,: null
    you just get more and more frustrated: null
    you know, they have all that parties for them where they dress up.: null
    you may think this is funny,: null
    you might have problems,: null
    you really have to make, quite a bit of money.: null
    you seem to be making out all right.: null
    you will get to different levels.: null
    you're not getting any further, along: null
    you're not,: null
    you're really ready to learn finally.: null
    you're trying, to support, four kids,: null
    you're, you're participating,: null
    you, you just it's, it's, kind of an eyeopener.: null

    I think it would be fun for them.: null
    I think it's a, k, some kind of a s, a screwing thing that just rips it right out.: null
    I think it's not a native Texan tree.: null
    I think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used.: null
    I think our cabbages, and broccolis and that we have more trouble with, that type of thing, with the, the,: null
    I think people do.: null
    I think so too.: null
    I think so,: null
    I think that most women's garden clubs that I've been aware of in the past, are only flowers,: null
    I think that we're going to try that.: null
    I think they are stopped blooming now, in the Spring.: null
    I think they're real pretty when it rains because their petals don't soak the rain in.: null
    I think we figured out total, this is for vegetables: null
    I think we have one of the nicest yards in the, in the neighborhood .: null
    ? I think we used Dursban for the, we used Dursban and Diazinon and get out there
      and do what you do with that thing, and spread it all out everywhere,
    : null
    I think we'll probably experience some of your weather although I think they have more humidity.: null
    ? I think, I was thinking about throwing some for, in the back, just where the
      kids, just way in the back, behind the swing sets
    : null
    I thought I'd grab one of these days,: null
    I thought everybody was gardening,: null
    I thought phooey, I'm going to do it myself because I figured up the cost: null
    I thought you were going to say there: null
    I thought, how did this get here: null
    I thought, this is going to be interesting.: null
    I thought, this is, this is unreal,: null
    I threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there: null
    I tied the yellow ribbon around it,: null
    I took it back home,: null
    I took it off and put it on my door.: null
    I took the,: null
    I took them out of my front yard,: null
    I took them to a certified, nurseryman the other day,: null
    I tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots .: null
    I try and do as much, flowering as I can, and: null
    I try not to even use insecticides on my lawn,: null
    I unfortunately am not gardening this year.: null
    I use a, one of those black poker hoses that actually oozes water every where: null
    I use my Golden Delicious,: null
    I used to live in Arizona,: null
    I used to until it, I got so allergic to it.: null
    I usually have a pretty nice lawn,: null
    I usually say hello to wife and kids,: null
    I waited too late to really plant stuff.: null
    I wal, I mow my own lawn.: null
    I want to make some flower beds,: null
    I want to write this down because,: null
    I wanted to go out and kill them too.: null
    I was beating on the phone going,: null
    ? I was even planning to go out and to, dig up some hibiscus plants that will
      not make it through the winter here, but, were planted in the ground since last
      spring
    : null
    I was firmly convinced the entire,: null
    I was from the city when we got married,: null
    ? I was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and, and spending too much money
      on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding,
    : null
    I was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me,: null
    I was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn: null
    I was raised in New York,: null
    I was so mad.: null
    I was surprised how easy it was.: null
    I was used to the heat,: null
    I was used to what couldn't grow down there,: null
    I was working at that time fulltime and didn't have a lot of time,: null
    I was, I was conditioned to it: null
    I waste it up and down there a couple of times,: null
    I went ahead and planted one, and mine looks better than his .: null
    I went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds I was allergic to.: null
    I went and took a shower and looked back out there: null
    I went out there this Spring,: null
    I went, now you tell me.: null
    I will get,: null
    I will pay someone to do it .: null
    I will tell you another plant that is purply .: null
    I wish I could be doing that .: null
    I wish I could say that.: null
    I wish I knew more to tell you why,: null
    I wish this phone would stop screeching,: null
    I work for a school system: null
    I work for the state as, as a grounds keeper.: null
    I work on a, landscape committee for our neighborhood.: null
    I would have no idea .: null
    I would like to have a garden,: null
    I would like to have one that would bloom next year too.: null
    I would love to have different fruit trees.: null
    I would much prefer,: null
    I would rather a snake,: null
    I would took, I took and just mowed over them last year.: null
    I would, collect the corn very carefully, ear by ear,: null
    I wouldn't want to look at them.: null
    I'd know the place, anyway.: null
    I'd like to do that.: null
    I'd like to get one of these little small ones,: null
    I'd like to try, just try something new,: null
    I'd rather be doing that, than housework .: null
    I'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for Halloween and Christmas,: null
    I'll go nothing,: null
    I'll have to admit I don't, I do my own yard.: null
    I'll have to remember that, because hopefully we won't have them this year,: null
    I'll help rake up the grass,: null
    I'll make an L shape I've put my cantaloupe.: null
    I'll never forget.: null
    I'll probably go outside today and plant that.: null
    I'll put some on the bushes.: null
    I'll remember that if we see it's a problem in the yard.: null
    I'm a college student: null
    I'm a golfer,: null
    I'm able to do that, because I get home a little earlier,: null
    I'm afraid of the hills: null
    I'm all talked out about gardens.: null
    I'm allergic to grass.: null
    I'm an engineer,: null
    I'm enjoying hearing you so much .: null
    I'm excited about it.: null
    I'm from Chicago,: null
    I'm from New Jersey originally.: null
    I'm from, Te, from, Colorado originally: null
    I'm g, I'm going, Gee, this can't,: null
    I'm glad I have an old enough son to do it for me now.: null
    I'm going to do it again.: null
    I'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil.: null
    I'm going to,: null
    I'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe I won't have, I'll have less of a bug problem: null
    I'm hoping this works.: null
    I'm just inside the city limits,: null
    I'm just real discouraged with the whole thing.: null
    I'm looking at him like, Jeez.: null
    I'm no help on that, then. Because,: null
    I'm not allergic to things,: null
    I'm not going to, no goi, I'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there.: null
    I'm not limited to,: null
    I'm not really worried about it,: null
    I'm not sure: null
    I'm only a mile,: null
    I'm only forty years old.: null
    I'm originally from Pennsylvania,: null
    I'm plagued with those things,: null
    I'm plagued with those.: null
    I'm probably a mile, mile and a half inside the city limits,: null
    I'm sitting on a hill,: null
    I'm sort of waiting for Indian Summer: null
    I'm sure you have plenty of trees.: null
    I'm thinking White Narcissus or something: null
    I'm trying to establish a good root, root growth: null
    I'm trying to think of what they are, what kind,: null
    I'm trying,: null
    I'm with a defense contractor.: null
    I'm, I wish you, good luck,: null
    I'm, I'm a putterer.: null
    I'm, I'm kind of bad about that.: null
    I'm, I'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn: null
    I'm, I'm with T I.: null
    I've been called a lot,: null
    I've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back,: null
    I've been doing a lot of fertilizing.: null
    I've been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn,: null
    I've been watching them every day: null
    I've been, I was down in for a week,: null
    I've called a couple of times,: null
    ? I've discovered that, impatiens that tried and true is, turns out to be about
      the best thing to use there along with coleus.
    : null
    I've got carrots, I've got a few carrots up: null
    I've got enough room to throw horseshoes.: null
    I've got pre, two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard. one on either side of the yard.: null
    I've got some broccoli, onions some, some radishes and, beets.: null
    I've got some problems with, two trees in my front yard,: null
    I've got some radishes up,: null
    I've got some tomatoes still growing,: null
    I've got some, bushes around the fou, foundation planning, things like that,: null
    I've had Dallas, Arlington.: null
    I've had, one Plano: null
    I've just never really,: null
    I've lived in Utah my whole life: null
    I've never belonged to a garden club because I've always been more interested in just doing what I can do on my own,: null
    I've never done potato.: null
    I've never eaten dandelions: null
    I've never had,: null
    I've never seen one.: null
    I've never tried any dandelions just to eat.: null
    I've never,: null
    I've participated probably in about maybe, I don't know, seven calls: null
    I've put my cucumbers down at one end of the garden: null
    I've seen a lot of people that do that.: null
    I've seen a lot of people use them, for flower beds,: null
    I've seen, elderly people: null
    I've tried dandelion wine: null
    I've tried out in the front: null
    I've tried to, I spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there: null
    I've worked on that with a little chewing gum, which I shouldn't do,: null
    I've, I haven't seen any signs yet.: null
    I've, I've been trying, a mixture of, the bermuda and the rye,: null
    I, I always have geraniums: null
    I, I always know that why I'm not a farmer when I garden though,: null
    I, I cut it: null
    I, I do a lot of the, a lot of the, the ba, the back work, and stuff.: null
    I, I do not much care for them.: null
    I, I don't enjoy watering.: null
    I, I don't know how to get rid of these big trees, because one has a circumference of about ten inches,: null
    I, I don't think I'll do it again .: null
    I, I don't use, I, I seldom use anything harsher than seven dust,: null
    I, I enjoy it.: null
    I, I enjoy most of it,: null
    I, I got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago.: null
    I, I guess first of all I'll just say we haven't done much, gardening.: null
    I, I guess, growing up on the farm and, and that, I, I've always had a big interest,: null
    I, I have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family: null
    I, I haven't had to plant any trees because I've got so many,: null
    I, I just get really upset every time I make that check out.: null
    I, I just think of all of the money that they, that they're going to have to spend just getting that.: null
    I, I keep hearing all the stories of, of different parts of town.: null
    I, I like it,: null
    I, I love blackberries: null
    I, I moved to Dallas about five years ago,: null
    I, I mow it, with a mulch mower so the, the particles fall down: null
    I, I picked off twenty of them: null
    I, I really don't enjoy doing that.: null
    I, I really don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that,: null
    I, I really enjoy it,: null
    I, I really enjoy it.: null
    I, I really like to do the vegetables.: null
    I, I ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back.: null
    I, I think the , I think that's pretty much what we have decided.: null
    I, I think what we're, what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break: null
    I, I try to grow, a vegetable garden: null
    I, I usually get it started for my wife: null
    I, I was in England once,: null
    I, I'd hate it,: null
    I, I'm, I'm, of course, I'm a T I er,: null
    I, I, I personally work with someone that, that is deaf, and cannot speak.: null
    I, I, I'm amazed because the sun is so intense,: null
    I, I, I, we just got a, a old push, Sears mower.: null
    I, burned my grass off here in the last couple of days: null
    I, g, I talked to someone woman from Oklahoma City and some woman from Dallas: null
    I, i, it, it is dark purply, kind of a purply blue red.: null
    I, it's been fifteen years now, since we first moved to Texas, we've had it,: null
    I, she moves it around ever other day.: null
    I, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying: null
    I, try not to use any insecticides at all.: null
    I, what I did with my garden, is I have a, a two by six frame that's five by ten.: null
    I, what do I do, cut it one, and, and edge it: null
    If I can just nuke it, I would do it.: null
    If I have a problem discipline, I think,: null
    If they lived here, a lot of people I know just say, I just stomp on them.: null
    If they survive this year.: null
    If you don't have a frost you'll be all right .: null
    ? In fact I received as a Christmas present a, a planter that had bulbs in it,
      that we were supposed to go ahead and water it any time and after it started
      to sprout put in a sunny window,
    : null
    In fact, I, my mother, who is eightysix years old, canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year.: null
    In fact, my mother once tore up our entire back yard ,: null
    In fact, we even, we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that,: null
    It did pretty well,: null
    It had held onto a small portion,: null
    It is a bulb.: null
    It is a wildflower here,: null
    It is beautiful here: null
    It is just terrific,: null
    It is over with.: null
    It is sold down here as Purple Buddy.: null
    It is some type of iris though.: null
    It is very interesting, subject,: null
    It is wide open, and flat: null
    It is, it is very, very nice.: null
    It is, it's not my favorite,: null
    It just happened automatically.: null
    It just happened.: null
    It just keeps growing and growing: null
    It just really,: null
    It just seems like I here it on the news the day before.: null
    It must be the,: null
    It only blooms for one day.: null
    It really made me mad.: null
    It took a lot of money and a lot of time,: null
    It was a hyacinth.: null
    It was just horrible.: null
    It was like you'd go out in the yard to water something, you'd just be standing still.: null
    It was nice,: null
    It was really bad because of the water.: null
    It was really nice.: null
    It was, it was: null
    It wasn't too much of a job,: null
    It's TEXAS GARDENING.: null
    It's a long skinny one: null
    It's a nightmare.: null
    It's about two hours north of Pittsburgh.: null
    It's amazing,: null
    It's beautiful,: null
    It's fifteen miles west of Washington, D C.: null
    It's just a real fancy decorated boot.: null
    It's just a small one,: null
    It's just a suggested topic.: null
    It's just nice and green right now .: null
    It's just so nice.: null
    It's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives,: null
    It's just trying to keep anything.: null
    It's kind of, it's kind of disappointing.: null
    It's like, I'm not standing in a mound, though.: null
    It's not on a main road.: null
    It's not quite that hot.: null
    It's pretty nice.: null
    It's pretty remarkable because growing up we've always had a beautiful, lush green lawn,: null
    It's really been a remarkable year.: null
    It's really nice.: null
    It's supposed to die off in August,: null
    It's the first and only time I've done that.: null
    It's what they've done in the spring: null
    It's, I just have a small plot it's ten feet by five feet.: null
    It's, I think it's just called TEXAS GARDENING,: null
    It's, bermuda.: null
    It's, it's been wonderful to have the peaches.: null
    It's, it's really her joy: null
    It's, it's solid limestone.: null
    It, it's always something that seems so odd to me: null
    It, it's really a pain.: null
    Its p, p, proper name is Gomphrena.: null
    June bugs is what I'd heard them called,: null
    Just about anything you would want in Texas as a gardener is here just around us.: null
    Just awful.: null
    Just moved to, to North Carolina,: null
    Just rearranged some things .: null
    Killing lots of fire ants.: null
    Last year, I think it was, my peonies were, were, budding in January,: null
    Lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do.: null
    Like I said, I'm just a balcony kind of gardener with my little flowers and my flower boxes and my herbs on: null
    Man, we get the best strawberries, that you just can't believe.: null
    Maybe they will if, up further north.: null
    Me, personally can't,: null
    My does, mot, mother will be th, ninety this year: null
    My house is on a main road,: null
    My husband does all that stuff.: null
    My husband finally said, Look, are we going to take the grass? .: null
    My husband will have problems borrowing one.: null
    My husband works a lot: null
    My mom put, cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once,: null
    My neighbor across the street has one.: null
    My neighbor has pear trees, and, blueberries, all kinds of food around there, if we just had time to take advantage of it.: null
    My problem is not having enough time to do the job as completely and as thoroughly as I would like.: null
    My son does the mowing of the grass.: null
    My wife and I, we live in Dallas too,: null
    My wife can't understand: null
    ? My wife has spent probably I don't know how many hours in the last two or three
      weeks canning pears, because there were so many of them,
    : null
    My wife is in charge of the flowers.: null
    My wife used to plant a few snow peas.: null
    My wife works in, at, at, at the T I,: null
    My, my parentsinlaw they're, they're building a house into the side of a hill,: null
    My, my sister is very over zealous, too.: null
    Next year I was planting some broccoli and, and some of those, they're called cabbage,: null
    No idea whatsoever.: null
    Not in Texas.: null
    Not really .: null
    Now I like to go to the beach where the sand is,: null
    Now it is going to grow about, the plant itself will grow about eighteen inches tall.: null
    Now our cancer society sales daffodils.: null
    Now th, the one that, the one that we lost, the last one that we lost a, a year ago: null
    Now that's, that's something that grows like a weed here.: null
    Of course it's real hot here too.: null
    Ohio's a very pretty state.: null
    On my driveway, I guess, that's what they do: null
    On the other side of the house, though, that's where we have all the, the delicate flowers and the mums,: null
    One is a bedroom for our, our oldest son: null
    One year I didn't put anything on: null
    Our house in Castroville was the first one, too.: null
    Our mums are, are beautiful,: null
    Our time will be up.: null
    Ours are going to be coming out.: null
    Ours don't.: null
    Ours is pretty small, too,: null
    People that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation: null
    Pittosporum is kind of borderline here: null
    Powdered sulphur.: null
    Purple Buddy.: null
    Right now I know the azaleas and everything are out are beautiful.: null
    Right now, they're, they're big now.: null
    Saint Augustine,: null
    Saint Augustine, I think, is what we have.: null
    See I got mine in,: null
    Seems like it.: null
    She can speak,: null
    She does all of the flower gardening throughout the whole property,: null
    She likes to really get into her pumpkins: null
    She made these onion rings that were so good,: null
    She plans it all out.: null
    She plants a lot of tomatoes: null
    She puts a lot of financial.: null
    She puts a lot of time into them.: null
    She said, You should have done pansies.: null
    She's eaten my crepe myrtle trees.: null
    She's got some really nice flower beds.: null
    She, she starts her own plants.: null
    Snow peas are up: null
    So do ours,: null
    So would I .: null
    Some beet, potatoes: null
    Some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings.: null
    Some people have, I think it's fescue: null
    Sometimes I wish I could get one of these, chemical services to come,: null
    Sometimes we have really good luck with them,: null
    Sometimes when my dad has,: null
    Southwest Houston.: null
    Southwest, southwest side of Houston.: null
    Speak and Math, devices.: null
    Sperry said, that's what happened to the Crepe Myrtles,: null
    T I is very good, has done a lot of experiments in the speech,: null
    Texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants, because our summers are so terribly hot: null
    Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry,: null
    Th, it's ten because I,: null
    That helps a whole bunch.: null
    That is what I did with my plants.: null
    That is what they call them down here.: null
    That was all that was there.: null
    That was the only thing I didn't like about lawns,: null
    That what the look like,: null
    That will come back up.: null
    That'd be neat.: null
    That's all right.: null
    That's another story.: null
    That's basically what he was trying to tell us.: null
    That's one part of gardening I haven't tried yet,: null
    That's the bad thing there, is, that we spent so much money,: null
    That's the extent of our, contributing to our food supply.: null
    That's what I remember from living up north, is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost: null
    That's what our two rooms are on the front, too, with these long windows.: null
    That's what they look like.: null
    That's what we do too.: null
    That's why I'm help, having him help me now .: null
    That, that's my only thing with him.: null
    That, they, they warned me of that one finally.: null
    The bag is still out there because I haven't touched it.: null
    The blooms are, on some of them is yellow, purple, white. Just all different colors.: null
    The first one, they started them indoors this time.: null
    The flavor is better I think in between.: null
    The ones that roll up in a ball.: null
    The question was on lawn and garden work.: null
    The rest of it is just wild flowers: null
    The whole, perimeter bordering the house is all in Texas wildflower beds.: null
    The, in Plano, and the soil has so much, has such a high clay content,: null
    The, the other problem that we have,: null
    The, the petunias were really great.: null
    Then they sold the house and got divorced,: null
    There are some oaks, magnolias, and plum trees, peach trees,: null
    There are two out front: null
    There was a lilac tree,: null
    There was one when,: null
    There was some plants that are just Spring bloomers: null
    There, there is some great people from Texas A and M,: null
    There, there's so much money: null
    These look like a lily.: null
    These people,: null
    They , they, they still haven't gotten used to the dry land farming: null
    They bloom in the Spring.: null
    They bloomed in the Spring.: null
    They call it: null
    They certainly enjoy that part of it .: null
    They come up real pretty,: null
    They didn't have any shade .: null
    They don't real, they don't have to be touching or anything,: null
    They don't, they don't even start growing until May,: null
    They get, just one bloom on the plant.: null
    They got that, what is that safer soap,: null
    They had no right to live.: null
    They have a huge yard and a huge house,: null
    They have about two or three acres of land on lake front property,: null
    They have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something.: null
    They have to water an incredible amount.: null
    They look like a, a, they really look like an orchid when they come out.: null
    They look like they've got,: null
    They remodeled the entire back yard.: null
    They said that every yard has some: null
    They said that they are irises.: null
    They say the roots have developed: null
    They take care of basically the front yards and: null
    They take care of the, landscape,: null
    They were just covered with them,: null
    They would just turn it on: null
    They're about, I guess, a third the size of your, palm of your hand: null
    They're both running around now.: null
    They're just delicious.: null
    They're kin, they're kind of like the bush roses.: null
    They're like a, water bug,: null
    They're not a slug.: null
    They're not real hard,: null
    They're pretty.: null
    They're real common around here.: null
    They're real fat little white things,: null
    They're two different vegetables that way,: null
    They're up and doing fine.: null
    They're, they're nice and green,: null
    They're, they're orange: null
    They've been living there for about three months now,: null
    They've done a couple of little seed projects,: null
    They, any time they had people over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during the day.: null
    They, they have had Speak and Spell and all that for years: null
    They, they keep the, the rain on the outside, little rain: null
    This is my first year in a, in a house where I'm thinking about doing some flower beds and stuff.: null
    This year, this last season it was too wet up here: null
    This, this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the,: null
    Three we, three we've lost to, to, freezes between, eightythree and and then, a year ago we lost, another one.: null
    To water it: null
    Today we just had a lot of rain .: null
    Took me a long time.: null
    Wally's had one even when we haven't had big yard because, we enjoy that.: null
    We also grow, yellow and green squash,: null
    We always had gardens when I was, living in Chicago.: null
    We are going to mow and trim and: null
    We bought a, a large house that was completely unlandscaped.: null
    We came from nine years in a condo,: null
    We came here, we just moved into this, we moved in in November and put all, all the landscaping in this, this year.: null
    We did a few different times: null
    We did that too,: null
    We didn't have to, we have just a small garden,: null
    We do lawn work all the time.: null
    We do, we've got the direct sun in front: null
    We don't do anything exotic: null
    We don't even have any concrete: null
    We don't have a lot of sun, either, because it's big trees back there.: null
    We don't have really a Spring or a Fall: null
    We don't start anything indoors: null
    We don't, we don't usually cover ours.: null
    We dug under there about an inch: null
    We enjoy fooling around with it.: null
    We froze a lot of peppers.: null
    We got here at the end of about a four year drought.: null
    We got the, we got the question: null
    We grow bermuda and Saint Augustine here.: null
    We had a terrible summer,: null
    We had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago,: null
    We had fleas in our yard real bad last year,: null
    We had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought, Who'd want to eat that stuff.: null
    We have a peach tree.: null
    We have a plum that's just about ready to go,: null
    We have an old fashioned pipe sitting, that, water runs into: null
    We have blueberries, blackberries.: null
    We have one little flower garden: null
    We have quite a few roses.: null
    We have some people that have done their lawns,: null
    We have these,: null
    We have to allow extra room for those, because, extra space,: null
    We haven't really done too much else other than that.: null
    We just got our last tomatoes.: null
    We just, we have winter rye out back,: null
    We let some turn red.: null
    We live on a,: null
    We lived in the country: null
    We love fresh vegetables in the summer,: null
    We moved in here May, this house, May of last year.: null
    We moved, in seventysix we moved to Chicago,: null
    We need rain badly .: null
    We planted some yellow peppers this year.: null
    We really didn't plant anything.: null
    We tried corn,: null
    We tried to find them last year,: null
    We tried, we planted some fescue last, fall: null
    We trying to go, grow grass,: null
    We used to do it at home when I was a kid,: null
    We usually give them to everybody.: null
    We won't have too much here for another couple of months yet.: null
    We'll wish we'd planted bulbs and pansies already.: null
    We're going through that,: null
    We're ha, it's raining today.: null
    We're not having to mow every week religiously: null
    We're official now,: null
    We've got some good, Hybrid Burpee: null
    ? We've got, different flower beds in front and, a window box, a built in window
      box, trying to get some color back in those, get the trees trimmed up, get rid
      of a few weed problems and things like that.
    : null
    We've had a garden, for years and years and years,: null
    We've had a late fall: null
    We've had a whole lot of rain.: null
    We've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to: null
    We've tried it,: null
    We've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the s,: null
    We, after about a month, we finally got to mow this weekend.: null
    When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter, and their grass is fairly green.: null
    When we had our pool done I had them to leave some extra loam, for my garden: null
    When you touch them, they roll up.: null
    You find them under bricks and all that stuff, where it's moist,: null
    You find them under bricks usually, and that.: null
    You get one big flower that looks like a lily.: null
    You will see them blooming now.: null
    You're, you're making me hungry here.: null
    You, you don't have to put a whole lot out,: null
    a couple of them we've lost to, we've lost to wind,: null
    a little bit, .: null
    a lot of people,: null
    a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front, like the pittosporum all died,: null
    a lot of them have done well: null
    a lot of times I won't get out and do it,: null
    a lot of women do.: null
    a year, a year ago I took into,: null
    about this time of year there is, it starts getting a little old,: null
    about, just over a year ago I bought my own house,: null
    acorn squash are good winter keepers.: null
    actually this fall, I was talking about,: null
    ? after three years of working at it, I've, I've been amazed at just what a little
      bit of doing help out things to the lawn has really brought it back.
    : null
    again, it's just like the sun scorch.: null
    all of a sudden I came cross this big clump of weeds: null
    all the rest of my yard, backyard is, pool and decking: null
    all those variegated, things died.: null
    almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden.: null
    although I do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work.: null
    although again, we have to prepare the soil.: null
    and put out yellow and bronze: null
    and then it, then it's just a, a bush there from then on.: null
    and, and I have planted a lot of them.: null
    and, and saw it and stopped in and asked,: null
    another thing I've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes: null
    anything like that is, is a, major undertaking I guess,: null
    anyway, under our trees we get a, a north sun: null
    anyways I have a nice full tree now: null
    as a matter of fact, I've already done a second row of radishes.: null
    as far as gardening is concerned, we do enjoy it.: null
    as far as our bushes, we don't have any: null
    as far as our grass, it grows crazy here.: null
    as long as he won't damage it, fine,: null
    as soon as we're, sure we're not going to have another freeze,: null
    at least the area where,: null
    at my father's house, we have, my sister and I have a couple of gardens.: null
    at our house, as soon as you touch a vine, it's like it completely dies.: null
    at the first year,: null
    at the times, though, it's been not very appropriate,: null
    azaleas grow all over,: null
    back to gardening.: null
    basically he does all the heavy stuff,: null
    basically, I like to mow the lawn, believe it or not,: null
    because I can just see brushing up against it, that it would: null
    because I do like the, I like the plant in the Spring.: null
    because I started to say, you can, there's different times they say it's okay to do it.: null
    before the plane landed she looked out the window: null
    by the fence I had cucumbers, which, which didn't do real well,: null
    ? by the time they, the flowers would come back to life it was supposedly the
      time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting .
    : null
    by then it's burned up,: null
    by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops.: null
    can't say it.: null
    cucumbers here grow like crazy.: null
    different, a few different, hybrid tea type varieties.: null
    during the fall when it stopped, when, the rain let off just a little bit it, it just dried up.: null
    ? even though it's far out there, it's just that Lake , they have to, they, they
      try to do it just from the, selling the water.
    : null
    even up here at school, it gets hot, and we have the windows open,: null
    eventually, especially when it was so bad last year, I guess it was the year before now, it was so hot that year,: null
    every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals: null
    every time I have this phone is a little weird,: null
    every time we went outside, he'd look at something that was humongous,: null
    every time you do that, it, kind of kills the tree for a while.: null
    every year I grow a garden.: null
    every year it just seems to hang on,: null
    every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before. Like about these mums.: null
    every year.: null
    everybody, it seems like everyone is so particular, especially in the Dallas area.: null
    everyone can afford,: null
    everything in a pot will die: null
    everything just got hit hard .: null
    except, I do have some, some day lilies that: null
    flowers are primarily the emphasis,: null
    for many years I grew sweet corn,: null
    for the first time we planted them this year.: null
    for the last couple of years I've done it myself.: null
    for the most part we don't,: null
    for the most part, gardening for us is,: null
    from Ohio since we're right near Lake Erie: null
    from Pennsylvania and New Jersey,: null
    half the stuff would get frostbitten,: null
    haven't for, I guess I never have here, actually,: null
    he calls us,: null
    he does half: null
    he does that.: null
    he does the yard,: null
    he does the, edging and all that kind of thing,: null
    he doesn't gripe about it or anything,: null
    he had his own backyard garden, too.: null
    he had two acres that he had for his own grazing .: null
    he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree I think.: null
    he just says to keep spraying them so,: null
    he lets me, no problem borrowing if it's,: null
    he lived in that,: null
    he mows the lawn because the lawn mower is too heavy .: null
    he picks them up and rolls them across the patio.: null
    he plants about a quarter of an acre of sweet corn for me to use,: null
    he plays with them all time,: null
    he put it on the front yard: null
    he really isn't, real crazy about gardening.: null
    he said the vines are just so,: null
    he said, No,: null
    he told me I needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he said I should purchase.: null
    he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here: null
    he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower,: null
    he was going to plant in the earth, like he always has,: null
    he won't cut them is what he won't do.: null
    he won't pull them.: null
    he won't pull weeds.: null
    he'll do it,: null
    he's always had a garden out in the country.: null
    he's been having trouble with: null
    he's cutting it down .: null
    he's not a gardener.: null
    he, he doesn't really enjoy doing it,: null
    here they are supposed to last year around: null
    here we still do get some snow and ice and: null
    i, I thought, I'm going to do this all the time.: null
    i, it left the, it left, he left the chips,: null
    if I do any garden work, it's only when I go home in the Summer.: null
    if I left one bulb of each one of them, by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them.: null
    if I look out my window right now, I can see, couple of pine trees, some oak trees: null
    if I see any signs I'm going to spray them,: null
    if I went outside while he was mowing the grass, I was going to have a gigantic attack.: null
    if I, I didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow: null
    if he'll, if there's anything he'll hurt, we just don't put it out there any more.: null
    if he's going to do it, you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it.: null
    if it, we don't get some rain, they might limit it to not even four times,: null
    if that's not the problem ...: null
    if there's five weeks, I still pay forty.: null
    if they, if they go up: null
    if we had a chance to move, I think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified: null
    if we have any, the birds will pick or something,: null
    if you really water a lot, you can do it,: null
    if, if you touch them, they roll up in a ball.: null
    in Fairfax, Virginia.: null
    in Missouri City.: null
    in Oklahoma, it's the men's garden clubs that I would have wanted to join.: null
    ? in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas, they have just the, the minimum
      square footage for lots, to where you get a little bit of a backyard,
    : null
    in fact I've been cleaning, because I live in an apartment: null
    in fact this week, they came out with some new math,: null
    in fact today it's really warm,: null
    in fact, I didn't even fertilize it this year,: null
    in fact, I was going to go out today to buy some plants so I could put them in,: null
    ? in fact, I was prevented at tw, about thirty years ago with a life membership,
      from the Richmond, Virginia counsel of garden clubs.
    : null
    in fact, I'm at work today, believe it or not.: null
    in fact, that's what they use for gypsy moth,: null
    in fact, we put in some, some more roses yesterday.: null
    in terms of the fertilizing and,: null
    in that he doesn't really enjoy it,: null
    in the back I'd say we have about an eighth of an acre: null
    in the past we've had homes that haven't had any side walks,: null
    in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers.: null
    in the vegetable garden we grow, usually, what: null
    in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack: null
    in the winter, we have Bermuda grass: null
    in, in my back flower bed I have, tiger lilies: null
    it could be three feet by four feet or something.: null
    it did not help, let me tell you.: null
    it doesn't look like it can withstand too much,: null
    it doesn't take us that long because our, our yard is so small.: null
    it expands in their, in their, digestive tract: null
    it gives me time outdoors,: null
    it gives me time outdoors, and time around my house,: null
    ? it goes into the full gamut of gardening. everything from flowers to bulbs to
      perennials to grass to weeds to trees and to, how to prune.
    : null
    it goes real good on dandelions.: null
    it grows like a weed.: null
    it has been about three or four years of, playing around with flowers to de, decide which ones actually grow here.: null
    it has nothing .: null
    it is an annual.: null
    it is like, I will get out there and pull my weeds.: null
    it is not a perennial,: null
    it is really nice,: null
    it is tough: null
    it is ugly.: null
    it just gets so hot so fast here.: null
    it just happens they built a shopping center next to it: null
    it just seems so funny to me that, when I grew up in Missouri,: null
    it just, immediately heats up.: null
    it killed those too.: null
    it looks almost like a hyacinth only a, a lot higher.: null
    it looks just like orchids in different colors.: null
    it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them.: null
    it looks pretty good out there.: null
    it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it: null
    it really damaged the corn: null
    it really does,: null
    it really is.: null
    it really was.: null
    it runs first down: null
    it seems like it's, I don't know if it's late.: null
    it seems like, the weather,: null
    it sort of gets away from me: null
    it stayed pretty, pretty green throughout the winter,: null
    it takes about four hours to cut our grass.: null
    it talks about the different grasses to use for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas.: null
    it talks about, different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it: null
    it took so long.: null
    it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem.: null
    it was bare dirt in a lot of places: null
    it was delicious.: null
    it was exhilarating, for many years.: null
    it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better.: null
    it was just that I happened to organize this group,: null
    it was like, you could, you couldn't even stand still out there.: null
    it was never more than one to two hours old,: null
    it was nice.: null
    it was one big weed is what it was.: null
    it was quite a drag because, we got them in our house,: null
    it was raining continuously.: null
    it was so ugly.: null
    it was terrible.: null
    it was very con, very frustrating, because I didn't have the watering system: null
    it was very good: null
    it was weird, but the birds had, evidently just deposited them for us.: null
    it was, it was just too much work: null
    it wasn't because I was so good,: null
    it wasn't in Texas,: null
    it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something,: null
    it weighs twenty pounds or,: null
    it will send out a flower spike.: null
    it will take the heat down here.: null
    it will, it, it insists on full sun.: null
    it works great now that we've got it.: null
    it would cover it right up.: null
    it would just come off in the rake, down to the dirt.: null
    it would water their lawn: null
    it zaps it.: null
    it'd be a hundred degrees outside, I'll be out there.: null
    it's a crystal.: null
    it's a disease that it's got,: null
    it's a fairly large one to,: null
    it's a lot of work.: null
    it's a plant that we've had for probably twentyfive years that these: null
    it's all the dirt I have,: null
    it's already been built and everything.: null
    it's amazing what you can, how many plants you can plant in there: null
    it's an association fee.: null
    it's been a little more country with the trees,: null
    it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times.: null
    it's been raining pretty much continually now, off and on, maybe one day of break, for about a month.: null
    it's been real enjoyable, although I didn't do any this last fall, because our past winters have been so cold,: null
    it's been real fun here to see,: null
    it's been real hot here lately.: null
    it's delicious: null
    it's doing real well,: null
    it's forty a month.: null
    it's funny because the one, the two bushes on the ends of the house that I think are ugly, they lived: null
    it's got a boot, on the front of the book.: null
    it's great.: null
    it's here at work: null
    it's horrible.: null
    it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool,: null
    it's in the north end of Oak Cliff in, Kessler Park area,: null
    it's interesting country.: null
    it's interesting,: null
    it's it's very hot,: null
    it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here.: null
    it's just like, a high rise for elderly people.: null
    ? it's just like, something like an onion and a tomato would go together, but
      you're not supposed to put your onions near your beans.
    : null
    it's just one of the things I enjoy doing.: null
    it's just the: null
    it's just the, the bees and insects will do it.: null
    it's just unreal.: null
    it's just, here: null
    it's kind like this, box shape,: null
    it's kind of nice.: null
    it's like a little apartment building.: null
    it's like eightyfive degrees here,: null
    it's like the wind blows everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours: null
    it's mainly for flower bed,: null
    it's nice hearing you talk: null
    it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country.: null
    it's not as bad here,: null
    it's not as thick and as nice,: null
    it's pretty goo,: null
    it's pretty high alk, w,: null
    it's pretty hot down here during the Summer,: null
    it's pretty nice.: null
    it's pretty tough.: null
    it's probably about twenty by, twenty by six, something like that,: null
    it's probably, twentyfive by thirty or forty, something like that, that I put in my normal food garden things each year,: null
    it's quite time consuming, by the way.: null
    it's real fine, like flour: null
    it's really strange,: null
    it's really, really pretty,: null
    it's seventy a month.: null
    it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine.: null
    it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over: null
    it's so scrubby: null
    it's solid rock from then on down,: null
    it's supposed to rain again now, this weekend.: null
    it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard: null
    it's very, nice sandy soil, rich soil,: null
    it's what they call pecan, pecan pie up there in the East.: null
    it's, a little aggravating, ,: null
    it's, it's a little piece of land over there .: null
    it's, it's a pretty neat little job: null
    it's, it's a problem that's, that's moving south from, from the New England area.: null
    it's, it's all on Lake ,: null
    it's, it's on the: null
    it's, it's quite an undertaking.: null
    it's, it's, it's very str, strange that I got this call because my wife just called me.: null
    it's, it's, very small.: null
    it's, it, it, the house is forty years old: null
    it, it just, it just ripped it: null
    it, it looks quite formal.: null
    it, it takes about an hour with the two of us working: null
    it, it's amazing we also have roses,: null
    it, it's hard to go out when it's this hot.: null
    it, it's interesting,: null
    it, it's killing everything underneath: null
    it, it's, these things that you pamper,: null
    it, no, , not even, consider, considering a pool or anything like that, that's, that's,: null
    it, they, they turned out pretty poor.: null
    just go ahead and talk,: null
    just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty.: null
    just humidity: null
    just if you want a lot of, light for underneath,: null
    just if you've got a broadcast spreader: null
    just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts.: null
    just the air is so dry.: null
    just to smell the grass, it's just,: null
    just very lightly cover the entire yard.: null
    just, just scratching two or three inches was just a chore.: null
    keep the weeds out of them and, and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them.: null
    last Spring.: null
    last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes,: null
    last year was the first year we tried two new things.: null
    like I can of course: null
    like I said, I do not know anything about plants.: null
    like I say, my brotherinlaw . I get to Carrollton quite a bit.: null
    like I say, there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the backyard.: null
    like in the Fall,: null
    like you said that, that freeze that came.: null
    like you say, they cross pollinate just by bees,: null
    lo and behold, about five days ago, we had a freeze down to about, twentythree degrees or something: null
    lots of times they do.: null
    many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up,: null
    many of those until the last couple when, we had such an economic slowdown.: null
    maybe one of these days I'll have to get out there and mow,: null
    maybe this climate is a little better.: null
    maybe when I get older I'll find, some joy in that .: null
    maybe when the boys get a little older, we'll do some more planting,: null
    me, I'm, I'm real committed to it for about a week, and then I forget about it for a week,: null
    mine are up and bloomed already: null
    mine is mainly: null
    mine was freeze.: null
    mine's full of dandelions,: null
    mine's getting there.: null
    most of the houses here, if you have a pool, you don't have anything else in the backyard: null
    mostly snow removal,: null
    mostly they're from the area.: null
    mostly, we're not even to the point where we're getting into flowers,: null
    my backyard is, is sloping: null
    my backyard, we had it really nice,: null
    my dad used to work on them,: null
    my family used to live in Littleton, Massachusetts,: null
    my fatherinlaw says the mesquite trees are, they're, they're pretty smart,: null
    my flower gardens are always been on the ground.: null
    my garden is shaped that I can,: null
    my goodness,: null
    my husband does that, thank goodness, because I, that's not a pleasure for me .: null
    my husband does the majority of the, the, gardening, taking care of the lawn and fertilizing,: null
    my husband doesn't .: null
    my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff, that, that seems to be helping: null
    my husband made a little garden out there with some tomatoes and stuff in it,: null
    my husband takes it on,: null
    my husband was, digging the trenches because he didn't want to get a trencher,: null
    my husband, basically, does most of it,: null
    my husbands retired.: null
    my kids were there,: null
    my kids, when they were little they had given me some azaleas: null
    my mom grows,: null
    my mom likes flowers, so we have a lot of flowers too.: null
    my mom wanted a vegetable garden.: null
    my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way I cook them .: null
    my mother picks them when they're fat: null
    my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns: null
    my problem is I want to use those rail ties to build up a planter: null
    my son's, o, one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have ,: null
    my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall: null
    my wife and I really enjoy that sort of thing.: null
    my wife and I,: null
    my wife and everyone,: null
    my wife does, a small herb garden on the side.: null
    my wife puts them on pizzas.: null
    my, my whole section of my house is probably a tenth of an acre: null
    my, my wife and I, we planted on the, on the south side of our, of our house we planted some gardenias.: null
    next year, I'll do pansies.: null
    not really,: null
    not that I can type very fast either: null
    not, nearly as many as what's actually in the District.: null
    not, not growing up familiar with here, when I get a chance I listen to that Neil Sperry and do that .: null
    now I have the time: null
    now I, I've lost my excuse for that so I have to ,: null
    now all of a sudden it was being developed,: null
    now it's really growing: null
    now they died.: null
    now we have peach trees coming up,: null
    now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous, lush and green and beautiful,: null
    now, I work and I live in the city so, that sort a kind of hung it up.: null
    now, since we've been mowing it,: null
    occasionally I find them in the flower beds.: null
    of course I've got lots of weeds in mine because,: null
    of course we water a little bit,: null
    of course you're going to lose some that way: null
    of course, the, mine are old ordinary flowers, marigolds and, and that sort of thing.: null
    on Saturday,: null
    once I see these bugs around here, I'm just kind of out of it.: null
    one day we'll be able to do it,: null
    one good thing about it, I don't have to mow the grass: null
    one is a maple,: null
    one is, an office that my husband and I work in.: null
    one of the things I do remember was when it talked about the grass,: null
    one year we: null
    one's fifteen by four.: null
    one's ten by ten: null
    only, only one is really in the flower bed part: null
    other than the roses I don't have too many flowers.: null
    other years we've tried newspapers: null
    our backyard has so many bi, tall trees in it that there jus, there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard.: null
    our favorite is something called ,: null
    our gardening we lost,: null
    our lawn, is, is a big lawn because, because we live out in the country,: null
    our neighborhood is a planned development with, I think, it is seven hundred and fiftyfive families.: null
    our peaches they, they seem to be doing just fine,: null
    our water supply right now is bad.: null
    our yard doesn't have a sprinkler system, but the island does: null
    our, our garages come in from the back, from the alley: null
    our, our kids love pickles: null
    our, our yard is very, narrow: null
    ours seems to have slowed down here.: null
    out here, we don't have as many trees in Plano,: null
    out in the country,: null
    over here we get enough water automa, naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers,: null
    ? people came from miles and miles around to get that corn, because they knew
      it was individually picked and very, very fresh.
    : null
    plugs along.: null
    pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard.: null
    ? primarily once the weeds start in the back we were just, resigned to, the only
      way we were going to fix this one is that if you plow it all under
    : null
    put new ones out front.: null
    quite a few people were killed.: null
    rains a little too often.: null
    really all I do to it is,: null
    really the plants that I brought over and put out here are just about all.: null
    recently seven months: null
    right now we're just,: null
    right now where we're living we have the trees where their, roots are at the top of the ground everywhere over the ground.: null
    right now, the District,: null
    right now, we're just, this is, we just moved in in September,: null
    roaches and,: null
    see how many she can grow. Bas, corn, potatoes,: null
    seven yards of sand.: null
    she alw, she always grows, five different varieties,: null
    she brings them up here from Philadelphia and gives me all her extras.: null
    she can't speak very clearly: null
    she cooks them for an hour with some , ,: null
    she does her own thing and everything,: null
    she does, she helps me a lot, too.: null
    she doesn't have that big a garden,: null
    she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden.: null
    she enjoys mowing.: null
    she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the wintertime and starting them.: null
    ? she had belonged to this kind of society that every year, or every so many months
      they would send you different bulbs that they came out with.
    : null
    she has a bigger one than I do.: null
    she has a tomato plant year round.: null
    she has eaten everything I have put out there.: null
    she has flower gardens and bulbs, perennials and things.: null
    she in fact is a data entry person,: null
    she just plants a few for herself.: null
    she keeps it year round.: null
    she lives in western North Carolina: null
    she said, she said, there's no trees down there.: null
    she says those are going to die just the first frost.: null
    she starts her own stuff from seed now,: null
    she told me about the Utah Jazz,: null
    she types away all day,: null
    she used to love to do stuff like that.: null
    she was already in it.: null
    she would do that if, if we didn't tell her that she'd better not .: null
    she's an avid gardener,: null
    she's eaten the bushes.: null
    she's, sedentary all day long: null
    she, she reads all kinds of books,: null
    so is my favorite.: null
    some guy was doing a job in the neighborhood,: null
    some of the seeds drop.: null
    some people call them May beetles.: null
    some places, they, they, they really them for tax.: null
    some we do green: null
    sometimes I'll help him edge,: null
    sometimes I'm too busy to get out there and do it,: null
    sometimes I, I want to plant something, there's not enough room to plant.: null
    sometimes my son does it.: null
    sometimes they do essentially nothing,: null
    sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to.: null
    sometimes we've covered with the plastic,: null
    sometimes, they're not supposed to come back,: null
    sometimes, too, when we take out our garbage,: null
    ? sprinkler systems or anything, start to get real expensive because there's an
      awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock.
    : null
    sure enough, we d, had really mild weather until: null
    that I think really, hampered it a little bit.: null
    that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening,: null
    that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry, I'll tell you .: null
    that is a bulb.: null
    that is all we have been doing all weekend.: null
    that is one chore that we will pay him for, if he'll go do the yard work out, outside,: null
    that is where I went this year.: null
    that particular year they had just tons of rain,: null
    that purple ball,: null
    that really cuts into your backyard space,: null
    that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time: null
    that was a lot of work.: null
    that was it.: null
    that was like September, I think.: null
    that was my mother's, favorite bean: null
    that was so nice.: null
    that was the most energy invested in anything in the whole time I ever knew him .: null
    that was the year that I think it started out a hundred in February.: null
    that we have,: null
    that will bloom all Summer long: null
    that'll change: null
    that's about it,: null
    that's about it.: null
    that's about the extent of our lawn care.: null
    ? that's about the extent of what we've done, just a little bit on the patio,
      and waiting for the rain to subside so we can mow.
    : null
    that's about the size of most of them.: null
    that's all they work on.: null
    that's all.: null
    that's because I'm allergic to the grass.: null
    that's because we didn't hit one for a long time.: null
    that's for an additional,: null
    that's fun,: null
    that's just too much to water all at once,: null
    that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again.: null
    that's my thing,: null
    that's nice to have: null
    that's not too bad.: null
    that's one thing I miss about living up north, as I remember, the long Springs and long Falls and the cooler weather.: null
    that's one thing I noticed there.: null
    that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had, they had a beautiful garden in it.: null
    that's our next thing .: null
    that's really lovely.: null
    that's really nice.: null
    that's really very nice because it's a non toxic way of, of handling the problem.: null
    that's really what we want,: null
    that's something I've been, been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are,: null
    that's the bad thing.: null
    that's the kind that produces the best.: null
    that's the number one thing we do, whether we fertilize or anything else, just because we got burned so badly before.: null
    that's the one thing no one is allowed to touch except my dad.: null
    that's the same technique that is, for any of the other, little varmints that get in vegetables: null
    that's the way this was.: null
    that's the yankee way.: null
    that's what I'm saying,: null
    that's what he's worried about. The trees, or a bush, because lilac bushes, they, they grow fast.: null
    that's what my son calls them anyway.: null
    that's what they do.: null
    that's what they say the payoff is: null
    that's what we did when we first moved in, too.: null
    that's what we want.: null
    that's what we're looking forward to,: null
    that's where Plano is,: null
    that's why I look at my neighbors yard .: null
    that's why the front room is.: null
    that's, that's one thing that we a, we've had very poor luck with, with, is, in, in our yard is, is trees: null
    that's, that's strange with me.: null
    that's, we, that's what we're searching,: null
    that, that happened to us.: null
    that, that worked out very nicely too.: null
    the Golden Delicious were fantastic this year.: null
    the Saint Augustine and all that supposedly was back there just wasn't,: null
    the ants would start crawling up your legs.: null
    the area is so small: null
    the backyard has two great big, spruce and, and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall: null
    the backyard is just complete dark all day long.: null
    the cat was getting, fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house,: null
    the daffodils are out: null
    the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off,: null
    the first night, that around Halloween: null
    the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants: null
    the first thing I did was planted all kinds of trees,: null
    ? the first thing the, the old guy there at the stand asked is what part of town
      we lived in because he said, I've got, I've got a dozen different varieties
    : null
    the first thing we always plant is tomatoes: null
    the first year I had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries.: null
    the first year after: null
    the first year that we planted, I couldn't figure out, the,: null
    the first year, after we'd had a crop: null
    the flower petals were scattered all over the walk .: null
    the flowers I'm just,: null
    the flowers are out by the back of the house,: null
    the gardens are kind of old,: null
    the got cross pollinated by the bees: null
    the grass is, this lush green,: null
    the grass was dead everywhere.: null
    the green onions are coming along.: null
    the kids want to swing,: null
    the kids, I had to,: null
    ? the landlord cut it down said, Yeah, that's one thing you have to do is keep
      that lilac bush cut down so it doesn't rub up against the siding
    : null
    the last day, he said, Can't we leave the grass,: null
    the lea, when the blooms died, the leaves were just horrible looking.: null
    the leaves, I do not like them.: null
    the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other.: null
    the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it.: null
    the most careful thing we do on our yard every August is put down that Diazinon.: null
    the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was thirtytwo fifty for one bulb.: null
    the next morning as soon as the sun hits it, it open, it starts opening up: null
    ? the next spring, I guess in that March, every time we would go out and just
      try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed, we'd have big whole patches
      come up.
    : null
    the next year when she, weeded them out: null
    the one that, the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property,: null
    ? the one thing that I did notice is that people that have the underground irrigation
      systems, the sprinkler systems, just, that was the way to go
    : null
    the only problem is that I do quite a bit of traveling,: null
    the other one is out on the porch.: null
    the part I don't like, I guess, would be from December through February where you have to rake leaves: null
    the people that bought ours, bought the place, but, I knew that they would,: null
    the people that moved in next to us, they built a new house on the empty lot: null
    the place we've been living at, it's, we're, we're just leasing it.: null
    the plants do not make the winter time.: null
    the porch is pretty big,: null
    the reason I bought a townhouse is so that I wouldn't,: null
    the roses have been blooming for two weeks,: null
    the roses just seem to survive just fine there.: null
    the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it,: null
    the seeds go right through them.: null
    the sprinkler system that,: null
    the subjects are usually pretty interesting.: null
    the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter: null
    the taxes alone there, Lake: null
    the timer would run: null
    the topic today was gardening,: null
    the tree is fifteen feet high,: null
    the trees are just so tall: null
    ? the water usage, they try to limit, even though there's three or four streams
      that flow into it, people still use it enough in, in towns like Clarendon and
      other areas that, where they irrigate.
    : null
    the way that, bugs and weeds grow down here is very different from Chicago.: null
    the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow: null
    the weather is wonderful,: null
    the weather men yesterday were all alert,: null
    the wind blows all the leaves on from your neighbor after you rake yours,: null
    the worst part is controlling the weeds.: null
    the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here.: null
    the, e, nursery men will se, will sell you things here.: null
    the, the ice storms really are stressful on all the, the plants that we have around.: null
    the, the peonies have been out for now about three weeks: null
    the, the wind there, has been so bad that, they've tried to plant grass: null
    the, they called, bugs,: null
    the, we had a couple of good, real good wind storms,: null
    the, what, what trees were, were there when we moved in,: null
    then I got some nice, mums at Thanksgiving that I put in the pots out there: null
    then I have a pretty nice backyard,: null
    then I have to wait for my,: null
    then I put, a black plastic,: null
    then I've got, a twentyfive by twenty area that I do gardening, as far as, tomatoes and cucumbers and beans: null
    then it doesn't make me ill .: null
    then it is not, it is not a Dutch iris then.: null
    then my husband wanted a Labrador puppy,: null
    then there'll be maybe two years in a row that we can't get anything.: null
    then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper: null
    then they started to die, too.: null
    then, too, where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly. My water bill was high.: null
    there are all different kinds.: null
    there are no bugs there.: null
    there are some big tall oak trees ...: null
    there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that I know of,: null
    there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant,: null
    there is a island in the middle: null
    there is a machine that will: null
    there is a pond,: null
    there is a pool and they take care of the pool: null
    there is so many people that broke either their water main or their gas main doing it.: null
    there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those: null
    ? there must be ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that even if its raining,
      you can go out in our back yard and not get wet .
    : null
    there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick, my brother and I.: null
    there was dog dirt in it: null
    there was no such thing as watering your lawns: null
    there was no way that was going to make it,: null
    there was some heavy tornados, I guess in Kansas,: null
    there were seven different trees of, of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in,: null
    there's a big market for the nurseries and for the landscaping companies,: null
    there's a lot of edging to do: null
    there's a lot of market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the Dallas area: null
    there's a tremendous amount of pecan trees: null
    there's been a few different places I've lived where I've just n,: null
    there's even, there's bad chemicals in those too.: null
    there's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes.: null
    there's not really much I can do about that.: null
    there's so many things that they, they last for just a couple of weeks: null
    there's some great, folks,: null
    there's some, just some little flower beds,: null
    there's something really terrible going to happen,: null
    there's twelve kids in my family.: null
    there's, there's a few,: null
    there's, there's an established lawn and whatnot, flower beds, things like that,: null
    there, there, there is a vast variety here of, trees,: null
    these are accidental tomatos.: null
    these are just,: null
    they almost stick out like a, I guess not a sore thumb, a pretty thumb.: null
    they are a lot of people that do have pools around here: null
    they are just eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more.: null
    they are real easy to grow.: null
    they are, they are kind of in a labor of love.: null
    they are, they have, they're died down. they are dead now.: null
    they aren't trimmed at all.: null
    they bloom in,: null
    they blow through here all in the Spring.: null
    they call them flags up here down here, down here.: null
    they can pump water up from the shore,: null
    they can, they can they can pump water,: null
    they care of that: null
    they come in all different colors.: null
    they come up every year: null
    they devastate the trees: null
    they devoured it that quickly.: null
    they did okay that first night.: null
    they did real fine during the summertime: null
    they didn't have to worry about it at all.: null
    they do all the lawn: null
    they do get a little stringy.: null
    they do have some pine forest areas in wes, in wes, in east Texas: null
    they do their thing.: null
    they don't do anything.: null
    they don't do it in your yard.: null
    they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat: null
    they don't,: null
    they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like, peas,: null
    they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down.: null
    they get that saw,: null
    they grow wild here,: null
    they had a gardener,: null
    they had took root right where they were, on top of each other.: null
    they have T V s in the break areas: null
    they have all the water they want,: null
    they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn.: null
    they have the real velvety looking stuff inside: null
    they have to get permission: null
    they have to pay some kind of fee per year.: null
    they just don't like each other.: null
    they just grow rocks: null
    they just grow so beautifully.: null
    they just had their brand new little trees.: null
    they just live,: null
    they just, , have some problems,: null
    they keep hitting it, the tree with the lawn mower.: null
    they keep it warm with, for all the older people,: null
    they kind of came out looking like gourds.: null
    they lasted from, about when you harvest them about a month from now or so,: null
    they like to see things grow.: null
    they look like a lily, sort of.: null
    they look like different color ones,: null
    they look like orchids, is what they look like,: null
    they look real pretty after the rain.: null
    they look sort of like impatiens,: null
    they make delicious pies.: null
    they make, about a foot high plant.: null
    they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning.: null
    they never mentioned that problem .: null
    they only bloom for one day.: null
    they put up a nice fence,: null
    they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer.: null
    they said, no, it's, it's too old,: null
    they said, we just plan on spending the rest of our lives just, , getting this property developed.: null
    they seem to come back year after year,: null
    they send out this, this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it.: null
    they take care of the pond in the park area and that kind of thing.: null
    they take up a lot.: null
    they told me that they are the hardest things to,: null
    they were doing that.: null
    they were real expensive.: null
    they were so bad last year, even ticks.: null
    they will not grow down here.: null
    they would have bloomed pretty early.: null
    they would, they also edged,: null
    they'll, they'll: null
    they're about the smartest tree around.: null
    they're all gone at this point.: null
    they're better for the sun areas.: null
    they're big: null
    they're bold: null
    they're cedar elm,: null
    they're definitely enjoyable.: null
    they're eating pecans though .: null
    they're getting too thick,: null
    they're good both ways.: null
    they're just are real hearty also,: null
    they're just beautiful.: null
    they're just beginning to come out and bud.: null
    they're just gorgeous, then last week my mom comes in town,: null
    they're kind of fun to, to try,: null
    they're like,: null
    they're not quite: null
    they're okay.: null
    they're real full and everything, in the summer time: null
    they're smart,: null
    they're so heavy,: null
    they're wonderful,: null
    they're, I know they were still blooming up until about a, a few weeks ago.: null
    they're, right now though I think they're just, they're trying to get the trees planted and everything.: null
    they're, they're in pretty good condition.: null
    they're, they're up above a foot,: null
    they're, they're women.: null
    they've been pretty close together.: null
    they've been really good: null
    they've come out with some different ones: null
    they've come out with some new products,: null
    they've got miniblinds and stuff.: null
    they've, they've gone a few years of neglect.: null
    they, they have to be hardened to it: null
    they, they really need pruning.: null
    ? they, they spray, the government, sprays, t, two, three times in the spring
      when the, caterpillars are, are coming along because what they do, this, this,
      bacillus, the worms ingest it
    : null
    they, they sure were right,: null
    things the way we grow are carrots, cabbage, that sort of goes to waste: null
    this has been the first opportunity I've had to, be working on my own lawn and garden,: null
    this house that I have is just a three bedroom ranch: null
    this house, I really liked it and everything, but the yard was a lot to be desired.: null
    this is Saturday,: null
    this is an established and older home that we moved into,: null
    this is different for us because the other,: null
    this is going to be a switch for us for a week: null
    this is my third, third house I think, I've owned,: null
    this is out in west Texas,: null
    this is the first home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system,: null
    this last one had a fair sized root: null
    this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt, and some Saint Augustine.: null
    this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall, fall bulbs.: null
    this year I decided that,: null
    this year we put in a new lawn in a new home: null
    this year, he got lazy so I said, fine: null
    those kind of brown, Ju,: null
    those law, those lawns look nice during the winter,: null
    those onions, I think, we, we planted twice as much this year because, we got, on, onions: null
    today, I was, I got to laugh, because I tried it this morning,: null
    today, it's eightyfive degrees: null
    tomatoes grow like crazy at our house.: null
    tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks: null
    took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing,: null
    ? toward the end of the summer, when everything starts dying off and whatnot and
      then the light can get through the tree, then the grass starts growing.
    : null
    two o, two of them, the wind, the wind blew over: null
    two weeks ago: null
    typical lawn stuff.: null
    used to be a farm,: null
    usually it'll do pretty well,: null
    usually they have talk shows.: null
    usually they're the tea type things, where they have a little luncheon: null
    various other things,: null
    wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower,: null
    we all love pickles: null
    we are about to hit it in ten, few minutes.: null
    we call them Morning Glories up here.: null
    we can water, here in Patterson, I can water on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturday and Sunday, four days a week.: null
    we can't either.: null
    we can't seem to get ours green.: null
    ? we can't, we can't put in anything too big, as far as, shrubs and things like
      that because got to get a chance to find the, find the cracks in the rock.
    : null
    we could ch, we could really talk gardening a long time.: null
    ? we did a lot of gardening out there, and, mostly in raised beds so we could
      keep the, soil nice, because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil,
      very hard to, to grow, very hard to cultivate,
    : null
    we did not know in August to put down the, whatever it is for grub worms.: null
    we did that: null
    we didn't get too much corn,: null
    we didn't have any lawn and garden type duties.: null
    we didn't have that luxury,: null
    we didn't know the difference.: null
    we do a lot of things with perennials and, also a few annual plants,: null
    we do bring stuff in the garage and everything: null
    we do everything together.: null
    we do have a garden,: null
    we do have some blackberry bushes.: null
    we do miss that.: null
    we do our law, our, mowing ourselves and everything,: null
    we do our own out here, mow it ourselves and everything,: null
    we don't do much in the way of, flowers.: null
    we don't do our work here out of enjoyment so much as: null
    we don't do too much during the Summer, as far as tomatoes and stuff,: null
    we don't farm much,: null
    we don't have one: null
    we don't have that many bushes to put them on.: null
    we don't have that much property,: null
    we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison, which is good,: null
    we don't really put a lot of money into the,: null
    we don't really, we only freeze down here in January, and February, at the most.: null
    we don't want them back this year,: null
    we each have a third of an acre we do.: null
    we eat it, we,: null
    we ended up with these, these, things on the cantaloupe vines that, were looked like round big huge round cucumbers.: null
    we enjoy that,: null
    we found them: null
    we found them.: null
    we generally don't, we do our watering from our spring.: null
    we get each other down the street.: null
    we get hummingbirds come in the: null
    we go home,: null
    we going through the dust storms down here now,: null
    we got a few,: null
    we got asparagus,: null
    we got half our yield.: null
    we got one left at this point,: null
    we got rid of them, believe it or not, with smoke bombs, which is just about impossible to do,: null
    we grow a lot of food.: null
    we grow a lot of tomatoes,: null
    we grow a lot of, the basic, corn, potatoes.: null
    we grow broccoli.: null
    we grow those here, too,: null
    we had a drought: null
    we had a nice thing going there,: null
    we had a real problem last year with fleas,: null
    we had a small, farm house out in Castroville which is just, to the west of San Antonio: null
    we had a tree that was seventeen foot tall, or something like that, that he said, No, no, I am not taking the tree.: null
    we had an incentive there: null
    we had cucumbers coming up, in the middle of our okra,: null
    we had lived in a condominium before.: null
    we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening would run into: null
    we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence.: null
    we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything.: null
    we have a cat that comes in and out,: null
    we have a large family,: null
    we have a lot,: null
    we have a nice tree in the front: null
    we have a pool in our backyard,: null
    we have a pretty good size garden .: null
    we have a section of tomatoes,: null
    we have a separate area for the garden.: null
    we have a small backyard and small front yard: null
    we have about sixty acres that we have to plant.: null
    we have about ten acres,: null
    we have been,: null
    we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden: null
    we have ice storms every year.: null
    we have it just opposite here.: null
    we have morning glory: null
    we have one ugly pine tree.: null
    we have peach trees in the middle of our garden now, because we took peach seeds and dump them there, whenever the garden,: null
    we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here,: null
    we have some bushes, but we don't have too many,: null
    we have some flowers that have,: null
    we have that too.: null
    we have this God awful ugly thing.: null
    we have to bring them in here: null
    we have tried several years in a row,: null
    we have trumpet vine and moon flowers,: null
    we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold.: null
    we have virtually no room out in front,: null
    we have, I find that I have the time,: null
    we have, an acre, an acre and a half that the house is sitting in the middle of,: null
    we have, we have hills.: null
    we haven't had much luck with it we're going to try it again this year.: null
    we hired a professional landscaper to do it.: null
    we hit, a hundred, hundred and two sometimes,: null
    we just bought our house, last July,: null
    we just can't grow, grass underneath there.: null
    we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one,: null
    we just do,: null
    we just haven't been able to do that yet,: null
    we just kind of, decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden .: null
    we just moved to our first home,: null
    we just, we just have dogs and,: null
    we kind of have an understanding that, I, I said I'll do inside work you do outside work.: null
    we live in a culdesac: null
    we live in north of Dallas.: null
    we lived there for five years,: null
    we lost a lot of our root things, our squash and our potatoes,: null
    we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones.: null
    we may just be getting rid of that: null
    we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble,: null
    we plant cucumbers: null
    we planted corn last year too, which takes quite a bit of space: null
    we planted those out by the septic, so that, they get plenty of water: null
    we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas,: null
    we pretty much fill it up with, like I said, perennials, things that aren't, don't have to fool with every year,: null
    we pretty much go with that dwarf Yaupon and that Yaupon holly,: null
    we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it,: null
    we put , we fill it with lights and: null
    we put in a sprinkler system,: null
    we put the tomatoes there every year, in the same section.: null
    we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders.: null
    we screwed around and waited too long: null
    we set up a shop there,: null
    we started mowing our own lawn: null
    we still have a lot of privacy,: null
    we talked about basketball.: null
    we tried it, too, where you run it up a fence: null
    we trucked in,: null
    we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway.: null
    we use that to water our garden ,: null
    we used it for fleas.: null
    we usually get,: null
    we usually, we just dump it in the middle of the garden, after your garden's basically done: null
    we went out and covered them with a sheet,: null
    we were coming in: null
    we were dragging th, the sprinkler around everywhere.: null
    we were just watering all the time.: null
    we were not, our lawn is not perfect,: null
    we were orig, originally, of course, from this area, from Virginia,: null
    ? we were sitting there wondering, there must be a better way to landscape so
      that you don't have to spend so much money trying to keep the lawn alive and
      green and the weeds out.
    : null
    we were taking care of lawns out there,: null
    we're , we're struggling to find something for those areas.: null
    we're Christians,: null
    we're at the edge of a forest area, so there's a lot of pine mulch .: null
    we're building a stand, just to the north of our house, and along the east, property line: null
    we're finding out,: null
    we're getting replenished,: null
    we're going down to New Orleans: null
    we're going to be getting some wheel h,: null
    we're going to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead,: null
    we're going to have to do a lot of lawn and garden work there.: null
    we're going to have to do that because we have the shade, the trees,: null
    we're going to have tomatoes.: null
    we're going to talk about lawn and garden today.: null
    we're going to talk about our lawn and gard, garden chores,: null
    we're going to try that,: null
    we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year.: null
    we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own: null
    we're going to wait until we move.: null
    we're going to wait,: null
    we're in Dallas.: null
    we're in the process of, of planting: null
    we're in the process of, revitalizing the whole situation.: null
    we're just learning the ropes here: null
    we're just not real into the lawn probably because we're renting, I guess,: null
    we're just so happy to see green.: null
    we're just still at the point where we're talking about the necessity.: null
    we're leaving tomorrow: null
    we're neighbors.: null
    we're not doing too bad down here really,: null
    we're on a corner lot,: null
    we're over by Collin Creek Mall,: null
    we're planning on moving to Flower Mound,: null
    we're renting,: null
    we're still fighting bugs, and ready to change some of the, the summer flowers out: null
    we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden.: null
    we're trying to decide what, what to, what to put on one side of the house and things like that,: null
    we're, going, talking to some of our friends that are landscapers and things, and learning about different kinds of grass.: null
    we're, we're kind of experimenting right now.: null
    we've added bushes and, and shrubbery, too.: null
    we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time, find that it's really a little more economical,: null
    we've been planting flowers that we could never plant,: null
    ? we've been thinking, if we built up, a wood, wooden like trench thing around
      where our bushes were and filled it with a nice dirt
    : null
    we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and, and whatnot.: null
    we've been, we've been pretty lucky on that.: null
    we've done really well with them.: null
    ? we've given up, between the fire ants, the pill bugs, the weeds, the drought,
      and a hundred and ten degree heat all Summer,
    : null
    we've got a Great Dane in the back: null
    we've got some beets,: null
    we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato: null
    we've got some this year.: null
    we've got, we've got all the different lake editions around the house: null
    we've had a real nice mild Spring.: null
    we've had it for ov, he's been there for a long time: null
    we've had problems with our yard.: null
    we've had ticks before a lot,: null
    we've had to actually have the airconditioning on and everything: null
    we've had to get out and treat our lawn for that.: null
    we've never done anything like this: null
    we've sort of had an ideal Spring.: null
    we've spent the last twenty years in Oklahoma.: null
    we've tried having a vegetable garden,: null
    we've tried having,: null
    we've tried them,: null
    we've, we've got mayb, maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil,: null
    we, I have Bermuda,: null
    we, I've always had crude ones at my father's,: null
    we, everybody down here calls these flags. the irises I guess,: null
    we, had lots of tomatoes, and, zucchini: null
    we, this is the first house we've ever lived in,: null
    we, we call them native pecan trees: null
    we, we didn't ha, we didn't have any that were that,: null
    we, we didn't have too good luck with it,: null
    we, we do have a garden.: null
    we, we ha, we have, still have to spray some,: null
    we, we have a few, of the real short stem.: null
    we, we have daffodils,: null
    we, we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now, and the trees.: null
    we, we tried planting tomatoes last year: null
    we, we, my husband does the same thing,: null
    we, we, my sister uses probably a fertilizer.: null
    what I did, I switched to liquid,: null
    what I do do, and I've always done it is,: null
    what I just used a hand saw and sawed them off at, at,: null
    what I would like,: null
    what she would do is she would plant them, and they multiplied.: null
    what, what are they going to accomplish out of all this,: null
    whatever it was, there was a second there: null
    when I come down here, everybody told me they are flags.: null
    when I first came here everything was yellow,: null
    when I was smaller, we, my family lived in Tennessee: null
    when it comes to fertilize, then it would come to raking,: null
    when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water.: null
    when it gets dark, it closes: null
    when it gets wet, you don't even want to get out in the yard,: null
    when the water comes up, it comes on again,: null
    when they rollback an hour.: null
    when they would edge in, into the shrubbery and: null
    when we came up, here, to California, we're in the Monterrey area,: null
    when we decided to move, it was really funny because, like I said, I had a whole bunch of different kinds of things,: null
    when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful, we really miss it.: null
    when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house, there were no trees: null
    when we got this place the, the dirt was just overgrazed: null
    when we had our house, out in Castroville, the problem with ours is that the, plots there are a third of an acre .: null
    when we leave the doors open, they fly in the house.: null
    when we left, the back yard had some,: null
    when we move that's one of our priorities, is to get a house where we can have a, garden.: null
    when we moved in there we had a, a really wet backyard,: null
    when we moved in,: null
    when we moved into our house I just hated the bushes they had.: null
    when you have to pay for water, it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly.: null
    when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except the one,: null
    when you're as busy as one of those babies, you've got to eat most of the time.: null
    when you, when did you get a house,: null
    when, back when I was a kid, mom would send me out to weed the garden.: null
    where was the person last night: null
    wherever they pooped,: null
    while my husband was painting I went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at Calloway's: null
    why, everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has land, watering system.: null
    with that, why, our lawns do stay, pretty nice all summer, if you water.: null
    working in that condo, you didn't have to do anything: null
    you are not that much further north.: null
    you can bring them,: null
    you can get them in the nursery.: null
    you could see them.: null
    you didn't have to worry about growing grass there.: null
    you do a lot more area than I do.: null
    you do not have to tend to him.: null
    you have to keep the, the area moist: null
    you have to step down in them now: null
    you just, when you walk up to them they're covered with thorns.: null
    you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom: null
    you know why, because I grew up in North Carolina,: null
    you replant it in September: null
    you said that you had a garden.: null
    you think, Dallas, almost semitropical, you wouldn't have that kind of, that kind of problem,: null
    you would have because they do all kinds of, gardening and not just flowers like women do.: null
    you would spend so much money trying to keep a large lawn alive.: null
    you'd have to.: null
    you'll find someone, probably in the morning, I don't know: null
    you'll have a bud the evening before,: null
    you're ahead of me.: null
    you're basically paying,: null
    you, you don't have to put clumps of it,: null
    your talking what, just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes.: null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    A flyer's on every door every day.: null
    A lot of, a lot silt that comes in it just doesn't seem to hold it very well.: null
    A slug is actually kind of slimy: null
    About the only bloom, bulb that repeats well in my area is the, daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb.: null
    After the bloom dies, they are not pretty.: null
    Another thing I have that, is weird is the, a locus tree in the back yard.: null
    Bet you showed them.: null
    Dursban will get rid of just about anything, I think.: null
    Get out there on your hands and knees,: null
    Hey, you've got the right idea.: null
    I am going to bet you that is a lily. Because it is,: null
    I am going to bet you that,: null
    I am not so sure that Texans know what, what they have got.: null
    I bet you could answer a question for me.: null
    I bet you it is a Dutch iris.: null
    I bet you those are, I bet you what those things are, is a Dutch iris.: null
    I can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards.: null
    I don't know unless it,: null
    I don't see, I don't think my phone really does that,: null
    I don't think I could really eat the fruit off it without wondering.: null
    I don't think any of it comes back: null
    I don't, I don't, I just don't think you,: null
    I found one thing that, it's kind of a weird thing to say to put out on the lawn,: null
    I get into the gardening part of it, the fun part,: null
    I guess in the ice age, it, it, it's pushed a lot of, limestone and everything,: null
    I guess it'd go with my flowers.: null
    I guess it's, it's just what scents it gives off,: null
    I guess we better stick to the subject: null
    I guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest: null
    I guess you have mostly pine trees,: null
    I hope not .: null
    I just think it's ugly .: null
    I know with all that moisture, a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems.: null
    I said, you're not going to have to type on the computer one day,: null
    I think I know what they,: null
    ? I think all the trees that are here now were planted kind of like the Johnny
      Appleseed type trees, where people have come from,
    : null
    I think it was seven, cubic, seven yards, cubic yards,: null
    I think it's a big problem because we're in more of a tempered zone.: null
    I think that we even got our famous hundred year old pecan trees from Alabama and all that, too: null
    I think that's how they measure dirt: null
    I think the Saint Augustine and, Centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there: null
    ? I think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop, hundred and fifty
      years ago, because they are all over the place
    : null
    I think you have a lot more insects down there even than, than what we have.: null
    I think, really to get out there and dig in the dirt,: null
    I thought it sounded,: null
    I thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather.: null
    I will bet you those are Dutch iris.: null
    I would a, assume, too,: null
    I would definitely do it,: null
    I'm a little more fortunate I think from that point of view.: null
    I'm all for doing everything,: null
    I'm kind of like you: null
    I'm sure it is, different in the different areas.: null
    I'm sure the Indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of Dallas,: null
    I, I think it's coming up here soon.: null
    ? Instead of mowing in the same direction every time, changing, one day you'll,
      one time you'll cut it, cut the lawn the long way, then you'll go the opposite
      way, instead of going lengthways, you go width,
    : null
    It is really a pretty plant.: null
    It is some type of lily.: null
    It just seems like they, that, that even, pruning once a year is really not enough: null
    It makes the biggest difference,: null
    It might be handy,: null
    It seems like we are doing it here forever.: null
    It seems that, bermuda's, bermuda's fine: null
    It would be handy.: null
    It's cheap entertainment.: null
    It's going to be from the ground up.: null
    It's like next to nothing.: null
    It's not getting any better.: null
    It's pretty soon.: null
    It's worse than a rose bush.: null
    It's, it's ridiculous.: null
    Many times worse, because of course, it's a tree.: null
    Maybe next year they'll do better.: null
    More bad weather.: null
    Neither one of us: null
    Of course, the chemicals themselves when you buy them, they're expensive too.: null
    One nice thing with onions and, and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have,: null
    Pecans are probably not taken from Virginia,: null
    ? People that were building the new homes that put those in, that was, that was
      the only way to go because it was just so convenient.
    : null
    People would kill to have a lilac bush: null
    Small enough,: null
    Some people, would really like to have them,: null
    Takes a lot of room.: null
    That's a lot .: null
    That's coming up here pretty soon.: null
    That's kind of a,: null
    That's true.: null
    That's, a lot of people don't have that much space even.: null
    That, that is a key thing for shade: null
    The whole way.: null
    There's nothing like them.: null
    They are just pretty.: null
    They are, they're beautiful.: null
    They don't, it just looks so much better when it's up against the house, tiered up.: null
    They just don't have the same ones in the supermarket .: null
    They looked real pretty until about a week before Christmas,: null
    They probably just take it for granted then.: null
    They really go through it,: null
    They really grow nice: null
    They sure are,: null
    They usually come out at night,: null
    They were, they're delicious: null
    They're a pretty tree,: null
    They're beautiful.: null
    They're pretty neat little,: null
    They're the best kind.: null
    They're very expensive.: null
    They, they just run all over,: null
    They, they're like indestructible.: null
    This is a great subject because they're out there gardening,: null
    This is bad.: null
    This is so funny.: null
    Tornados, which is not the right subject,: null
    We do the same thing.: null
    We use a lot,: null
    When the days start getting a little longer,: null
    You probably have nice big pine,: null
    You'll see that on the evening news.: null
    You've had more freezing this Winter, this, Winter, I think.: null
    Your list is growing,: null
    a tree is always something very nice to have.: null
    again as I said, I think the, when the Indians were here there, there weren't any trees,: null
    all of a sudden you've got to do something else.: null
    any, at least they, they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing.: null
    blue is hard,: null
    blue looks so pretty: null
    but just, for them, they, they're going to have to start gardening.: null
    but ten dollars, or what d, what does he charge, not even that.: null
    cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too.: null
    especially up in Vermont there, you should have, some really nice soil.: null
    especially when the weather's not too hot or,: null
    even if you did get it under control, it seems like in just a few months it would all be back: null
    for someone who doesn't garden, I'd say, that, that's my biggest recommendation is to,: null
    for ten dollars a week, I don't see any reason: null
    gardening isn't, isn't high on the list,: null
    he sprays his yard,: null
    he's kind of like your wife.: null
    he's right.: null
    ? here in Dallas it's, I think they all were planted by the classical Johnny Appleseed,
      and Johnny Pecanseed, whatever you would call it,
    : null
    if they do come back next year, they are going to look real puny.: null
    if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long, they get in there.: null
    if you're not really committed to it,: null
    in the summer, that's great.: null
    it has really nothing to do with, actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that,: null
    it helps the grass come back.: null
    it is dog work,: null
    it just takes up, like you say, a lot of your garden area.: null
    it looks like it would hold the soil: null
    it makes, it makes for a, a different challenge,: null
    it really does the job.: null
    it really doesn't.: null
    it seem like it be just the opposite when you get,: null
    it seems like they come in spurts.: null
    it sounds like you, you've got your hands full .: null
    it stands out.: null
    it sure beats dragging hoses around.: null
    it takes up your whole space .: null
    it was really too late to do much.: null
    it will make, it will make them taste better I'm sure.: null
    it'll, it'll tear up a nice tiller .: null
    it's a lot of work: null
    it's awful the first house.: null
    it's funny because, you try so hard I think sometimes to, to, to do our yard: null
    it's going to be much faster, of course,: null
    it's nice to get out in the open air.: null
    it's not off the list.: null
    it's sort of like, .: null
    it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself.: null
    it's very therapeutic,: null
    just too much.: null
    kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds,: null
    let me tell you, they do not come back very well at all.: null
    maybe these,: null
    maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here.: null
    mine looks real good .: null
    most of the time I notice that, it takes forever to get a call through.: null
    not everybody enjoys it, though.: null
    not your neighbors, of course, they usually know nothing: null
    once it gets over seventy, seventyfive degrees that, it just dries up,: null
    our soil's not very good down here.: null
    people who do have them,: null
    people who don't have them think they're great.: null
    some people have really a green thumb,: null
    sure I'll be more then glad to pay him: null
    sure is a heck of a lot of work.: null
    that has got to be blooming this time of year.: null
    that makes it nice.: null
    that was late,: null
    that's a good investment there.: null
    that's a heck of a pla,: null
    that's amazing.: null
    that's great that you have them.: null
    that's nice,: null
    that's not very long.: null
    that's one of the hazards I guess of, having a, a yard.: null
    that's one, one aspect of a lot of those grasses, they go dormant.: null
    that's really what makes the most sense,: null
    that's so neat, because so many homes don't have that.: null
    that's what's nice about living more in the country,: null
    that's, gon, to be expected.: null
    the Texas soil isn't the greatest,: null
    the classical thing for the handicapped, too, person who can't type very fast: null
    the good stuff.: null
    the peach tree is, is a start: null
    the people that do have them, they spread, and they sprout all over th, their lawn.: null
    the quick growing,: null
    the rye does really well. Especially during the wintertime.: null
    the soil's probably so good: null
    the wild flowers are beautiful.: null
    the, the civilization has brought all kinds of experiments with all kinds of trees,: null
    there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes.: null
    there's such a, there's such a difference,: null
    there, these were like some mutant.: null
    they always try to give you a song and dance.: null
    they are pretty in the Spring .: null
    they be can be a real dickens.: null
    they get so tall,: null
    they help you.: null
    they just move to,: null
    they want too much money.: null
    they're expensive.: null
    they're kind of a pain,: null
    they're pretty tough,: null
    they're probably only in the South: null
    they're such a nice bright early Spring,: null
    they, they are the best.: null
    they, they bend over so fast: null
    they, they do.: null
    they, they,: null
    those are always pretty,: null
    those are enjoyable.: null
    those are nice.: null
    those numbers were, were great: null
    to help other people too, that's neat.: null
    wax leaf, wax leaf ligustrum is the same way.: null
    we really missed them when they were gone,: null
    we're not typical Texans.: null
    you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that's been laying around,: null
    you can get a head start on it.: null
    you can have it come on just early in the morning.: null
    you can improve your own soil there: null
    you can see it a little better: null
    you can't have a garden,: null
    you can't till it,: null
    you can, you can stand those.: null
    you don't get, seem to get that much for the space,: null
    you don't have to use so much water,: null
    you don't have to worry about any of that .: null
    you don't sound like it .: null
    you get them back again .: null
    you got to,: null
    you keep trading them .: null
    you might see them in your advertisements,: null
    you must have a lot of different stuff you get out of there,: null
    you need a house, I guess, to go through all of that.: null
    you need to pretty soon.: null
    you never have enough room do you think.: null
    you probably don't have to do much over there,: null
    you probably have all kinds of trees, the oaks and everything,: null
    you probably have rye grass up there.: null
    you really feel you can accomplish something: null
    you really, really: null
    ? you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your
      cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight.
    : null
    you would have to learn that, though,: null
    you'll be cool all year around,: null
    you're just going to have to talk to it: null
    you've got three or four months you're talking about: null
    you, spray in one part of your lawn,: null
    you, you have to work on.: null
    your, your trees grow up so well up there,: null

    : null
    I, I've just, started learning how to sew: null
    I, I've made a few of the, just the little valence curtains in my house, and: null

    I, I, I can crochet and knit.: null
    I, I, I've got a couple of articles published.: null
    I, and, even hobbies and crafts and sewing things like that, I, I think gee, I could do this or that,: null
    I, around with my hands and things like that: null
    I, don't seem to have as much spare time as I used to,: null
    I, in fact, I just bought a serger in December.: null
    I, kept that because she gave me that.: null
    I, like sports type things too.: null
    ? I, like to do a lot of bicycling when the weather allows, and during summer

    : null
    I, most of them I have bought, already clothed,: null
    I, my little brother lives in Austin right now.: null
    I, my neighbor did it first: null
    I, play trombone in the Plano Community Band.: null
    I, used to play it a lot when I was in school,: null
    I, was just in a supermarket: null
    I, what I said that I wasn't being real facetious about that.: null
    If I see something, I can copy it,: null
    If it tasted good, yeah.: null
    If we get a place where we can have both, it'll be great,: null
    If you ever start, be sure and start with a large piece that you can, a large flat plate.: null
    If, if somebody would lay it out for me, then I didn't mind cutting it out and sewing it.: null
    In Abilene, Texas.: null
    In fact that's what I was doing when you called.: null
    In fact, I did one, BILL THE CAT, from: null
    In fact, he's out there right now: null
    In fact, she's talked to a couple of people from North Carolina, I think.: null
    In fact, there is actually several of them here right now.: null
    It beats paying United Way.: null
    It came out really dark.: null
    It depends on how frequently they die, and: null
    It didn't take anything at all.: null
    It drives me crazy .: null
    It has been so long since I did it that: null
    It has completely died out two times.: null
    It is funny though, it is like I do not really want to cook for us .: null
    It is funny, when I was in high school, I made a blanket.: null
    It is just a work bench and a gazillion tools.: null
    It is just hard to find the time to sit there and do it.: null
    It is, it is something I enjoy doing.: null
    It keeps me very busy.: null
    It never has worked out completely.: null
    It really does.: null
    It seem like that's,: null
    It seems like all I got was,: null
    It seems like she hasn't talked to anybody from Dallas.: null
    It took me, quite a bit of time.: null
    It took, it took a while to do.: null
    It used to be tea spoons, was the thing.: null
    It was a real pretty rug.: null
    It was great,: null
    It was just a little different though.: null
    It was really easy.: null
    It was really,: null
    It was tough,: null
    It wasn't, there was no incentive for myself to leave,: null
    It will also do a rolled edge,: null
    It worked out real well, too.: null
    It worked out that way.: null
    It'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her.: null
    It's B, A, R, G, E, double L, O: null
    It's a good possibility.: null
    It's a great hobby,: null
    It's a little plastic things that sort of floats: null
    It's a lot easier.: null
    It's a, it's a mutant.: null
    It's an epoxy resin that you mix together.: null
    It's an, cloth I think.: null
    It's called J B Weld: null
    It's curly, as a matter of fact.: null
    It's funny, when you were talking about sewing, I love to do anything by hand with a needle.: null
    It's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it: null
    It's humid.: null
    It's just been so long since I've actually sat down and taken the time to do something like that.: null
    It's just hard.: null
    It's just me in the house,: null
    It's just the stud fees are so much, though.: null
    It's just wonderful after all,: null
    It's just, medium size short hair cat.: null
    It's kind of a hobnail: null
    It's kind of a, kind of a ivory color all over and: null
    It's kind of, kind of neat.: null
    It's like getting together with,: null
    It's like white glue,: null
    It's maybe once a year or something: null
    It's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend.: null
    It's not as exciting as it ,: null
    It's not like there are four or five of you there.: null
    It's not too difficult.: null
    It's not, any porcelain at all.: null
    It's not, it's probably not the best: null
    It's one of those things: null
    It's real pretty.: null
    It's so I find myself putting glasses on to, to watch T V and then taking them off to do needlework: null
    It's that cloth.: null
    It's very tedious if you don't have a whole group, you're not finishing a quilt in a long time .: null
    It's, I've never heard of it,: null
    It's, directly across the straight, state from Tulsa.: null
    It's, it has four, four threads instead of, the, the regular basic two threads.: null
    It's, it's right outside of Macon,: null
    It's, it's, taken up by activities with, work, with family, with, civic and Church responsibilities for me.: null
    It's, to high school kids, it's, alternative learning: null
    It, it comes from England and, fr, in the county of Devon.: null
    It, it just kind of depends on what you're, what you're planting,: null
    It, it was quite bit of work,: null
    It, it's funny because the one I have, every single month without fail she has babies.: null
    It, it's humid.: null
    It, unfortunately I guess for myself it wasn't, it was purely by my own choice.: null
    Italian food .: null
    June, July, August are,: null
    Just give it up.: null
    Just when I get some spare time here and there I'll work on it,: null
    Just, just sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and try to make a doll.: null
    Keeping fish, I guess: null
    Kind of made it sticky for a while.: null
    Like I said, I like doing a lot of outdoor stuff,: null
    Like my, oldest boy is involved in soccer: null
    Lots and lots of catnip,: null
    M C I s coming if, if, telemarketing is your bag.: null
    Mainly do reading.: null
    Maybe it's one of those retirement things .: null
    Maybe that's why they're so slow.: null
    Mile a Minute.: null
    Mine's pretty limited to my little, porch plants .: null
    Mine, sort of, he looks at the pattern: null
    Mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon.: null
    More like embroidery or something.: null
    Most of the okra that is growing around higher is, is, later okra.: null
    Mostly just stuff that I can, use right around the house: null
    Mostly, I think in a place where it's really cold they do it in the fall,: null
    My brotherinlaw works for the University, in Dallas.: null
    My business is, machine tool sales,: null
    My husband is even interested in it now.: null
    My husband is into cycling.: null
    My husband kept begging me,: null
    My mother was real heavy into crafts,: null
    My parents go camping a lot,: null
    My parents would have a fit probably.: null
    My problem, I guess is time,: null
    My schedule is like from nine to five thirty,: null
    My sister does, flower gardens.: null
    My sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck: null
    My sisters both seem to like it pretty well.: null
    My two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing.: null
    My wife and I spent a couple years, doing church work up in the state of Washington right,: null
    My wife had, just put in a bunch of, I want to say, they are pansies.: null
    My wife hates it,: null
    My, my children all ski: null
    My, my father is in the, in the antique business.: null
    My, my husband loves to fish.: null
    My, my kids are all grown.: null
    Needlepoint,: null
    Nobody would want me on their team.: null
    Not all of them being mine.: null
    Not at the same time.: null
    Not everybody shows up,: null
    Not really an indoor hobby type person unless the weather's really bad.: null
    Not that I don't like reporting,: null
    Nothing as big as a blanket.: null
    Now my latest one is classic cars.: null
    Now our temperatures down here, we're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties: null
    Now the part about sewing that I never liked was laying out the material and the pattern and cutting it out.: null
    Number one turned out just great,: null
    Of all sports, I think that would be my favorite, because I hate basketball: null
    Of course, I just have one beautiful p, with peonies, umbrella stand,: null
    Okay, I guess, we are just supposed to talk about things we do in our spare time.: null
    On the weekends I drive around, look to see, who is selling what.: null
    One of the things that I have made time for is, playing softball.: null
    One of these days I keep thinking I'm going to finish it because it would make a really pretty bedspread .: null
    Only going to breed them once.: null
    Only if there's baby fish.: null
    Or whatever I have.: null
    People say let me see some of your work.: null
    People would always bring them when they go to the countries,: null
    Personally I'd rather die a slow painful death: null
    Plattsburgh's kind of a,: null
    Pretty good.: null
    Probably o, about twenty.: null
    Probably the other thing I do which I am sure will sound horrible to you, but is I program for fun. on the computer.: null
    Reading that one last night.: null
    Real simple ones, I do.: null
    Right now I was just sitting here watching T V,: null
    Right up there near the golf course.: null
    Seattle is only about two and a half hours,: null
    ? She enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she's always got something
      to cover her, her legs and feet with while she is working on it.
    : null
    She gets right into it.: null
    She had crocheted a full bedspread.: null
    She hung it on the wall.: null
    She just taught china painting.: null
    She makes things for the kids for Christmas and nephews and nieces: null
    She put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants.: null
    She said, I know she doesn't get to touch it.: null
    She spends lots of money on them.: null
    She still likes her piano: null
    She's got just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and ba, tree bark all over her lawn .: null
    She's, she's just a little sweetheart.: null
    Since I've got cats, I decided to get some catnip.: null
    Since I've moved away they've had it redone.: null
    Sing pop music.: null
    So many of my crafts,: null
    Something like that.: null
    Something, something, to keep me occupied,: null
    Sometimes, when everybody's gone to bed, my kids are in bed and my husband in bed,: null
    Supposedly after the soil warms up.: null
    That I started when I was a little girl,: null
    That is pretty much like my husband.: null
    That is the reason, I don't play over there.: null
    That is usually where we play,: null
    That is when she did, I think.: null
    That was loads of fun.: null
    That was so simple .: null
    That'd be my self defense.: null
    That's babies.: null
    That's funny .: null
    That's interesting.: null
    That's just fantastic down there.: null
    That's just something I hadn't heard of: null
    That's so much easier.: null
    That's terrible.: null
    That's the name of it.: null
    That's the only thing,: null
    That's the way it is, was, there, too.: null
    That's the way looked at the whole thing here,: null
    That's what I would do, too.: null
    That's what everything turns.: null
    That's, it, that's the fun part, trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with,: null
    That, I hear they're hiring all over the place for that.: null
    That, that about covers mine: null
    The expensive ones.: null
    The first project I started out one was a big one,: null
    The girls love it.: null
    The moss grows,: null
    The two cities are very, very identical,: null
    The weather is divine.: null
    The weather is wonderful.: null
    Then I could be getting paid for something I love to do.: null
    Then I cut a V shape out of the back of them: null
    Then, then we had so much fun there,: null
    There aren't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing,: null
    ? There was a program on T V down here on the educational channel here a while
      back about a lot of little, little companies of one and two guys, up there,
    : null
    There's also a couple of large projects, baby afghans,: null
    There's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar: null
    There's lots of shades of greens.: null
    There's so many things I wish I had learned to do with my mother.: null
    There's something about working with wood that, that I enjoy, that,: null
    There's there's a few designs I guess I've done myself, but not very many.: null
    They always borrow a few of them.: null
    They can go fishing.: null
    They come out of nurseries mostly in Missouri and places like that.: null
    They didn't like it too much.: null
    They don't necessarily follow that any more,: null
    They don't, encompass, many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing.: null
    They had quite a few new ones come out last year, that they added to.: null
    ? They have been a couple of times, and, just getting to be outside, all the time
      and sleep in a tent. And that is really fun to them.
    : null
    They have the, they have the gloves on the paws: null
    They just get around and, and talk techy or, or else,: null
    They landscape their whole house with flower gardens.: null
    They last for a long time then.: null
    They looked really cute .: null
    They make them hard,: null
    They went and hid after they, after they got dried off.: null
    They wouldn't accept my, T I N number,: null
    They're pretty expensive.: null
    They're very expensive: null
    They've got great big ears,: null
    They, they all play different songs.: null
    They, those have been real popular with my family.: null
    Things to hang on the wall.: null
    This one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because I have a demo tape, if any one wants to listen.: null
    This was, this was, this was pasture land,: null
    Those are real,: null
    Tina enjoys, the other lady,: null
    To find broken,: null
    To tell you the truth, I'm, I'm, I'm not really worried.: null
    Today's his birthday.: null
    University of Texas in Dallas.: null
    Usually I think it's a little bit cheaper in the long run,: null
    Usually single crochet would, is, is always starts it off.: null
    We are a little lucky.: null
    We are really looking forward to it.: null
    We can't have that down here.: null
    We decided this year,: null
    We did, I did horseback riding, too,: null
    We do that too,: null
    We get disconnected all the time.: null
    We get lots of sunlight here,: null
    We go to Tulsa from time to time.: null
    We go, we go through Enid, quite a bit.: null
    We have a nine month old with another on the way: null
    We have a, a very small phone company down here.: null
    We have never done that before,: null
    We have to get a, we have to get a silver point Himie,: null
    We like that.: null
    We like to get out and walk,: null
    We live in an apartment also.: null
    We make all kinds of things just with dried flowers.: null
    We might, We might decide what's proper and what isn't,: null
    We missed it last year,: null
    We moved here from Enid, Oklahoma.: null
    We moved to Dallas about a year ago: null
    We planted, potatoes and onions and bell peppers.: null
    We rarely have to take those things in too.: null
    We snow ski at Mount Bachelor mostly: null
    We try to do everything we can together.: null
    We will be busy with that again.: null
    We'll start them inside: null
    We're in the sub, I'm in the suburb of Cleveland: null
    We're kind of out of, the natural tree area.: null
    We're kind of up on a, on a higher,: null
    We're to get one to three inches tonight.: null
    We're, we're about to get another breed,: null
    We're, we're about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff,: null
    We've transferred around,: null
    We, we want to breed her with a champion,: null
    Well that's about,: null
    What I did, when I was doing that was mostly pillows, for sofas and so forth,: null
    What they do is they work construction,: null
    When I do, crochet, it's usually the lacy Victorian type: null
    When I lived around in that area my brother would fly in from Chicago: null
    When I was a kid, we'd do the equivalent thing in the High Sierras.: null
    When I was growing up I was, was into coin collecting,: null
    When they're skiing they're fearless,: null
    Which is in now.: null
    Whistler and Black Home is in Canada,: null
    Y, you, you need it to do things like button holes,: null
    You always have to isolate those.: null
    You can do a lot with the Serger though.: null
    You can make, piping and cording: null
    You can't throw your sewing machine away.: null
    You don't have to worry about cleaning it up.: null
    You heard her in the background .: null
    You might put them in the ground just the first week of June: null
    a couple of hobbies that I also have is,: null
    a couple years ago when they, they sail,: null
    a gal who works, with T I on this project .: null
    a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams, we,: null
    a hundred dollars: null
    a lot of my sewing I kind of do out of necessity,: null
    ? a lot of the hobbies that I have right now are centered around my, my children
      and also things that my wife and I like to do
    : null
    a lot of times I'd help her with that.: null
    a, a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed,: null
    about thirtythree thousand miles a year.: null
    actually I'm from California: null
    actually I, I'm pretty untalented .: null
    actually my hobbies is mostly is my sports. Tennis,: null
    actually my hobbies now are T shirt making.: null
    actually the sewing isn't the hard part,: null
    actually, I'm not even sure,: null
    actually, it, if you, if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside, pretty much the end of May,: null
    after I got it done it was pretty dark, and ended up not being real smooth looking.: null
    after a while you make some stuff,: null
    after it dried out, it was, it was real hard,: null
    all I did is, I bought the car: null
    all means about fifteen to twenty percent,: null
    all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission.: null
    all that hoedown stuff.: null
    all you can do is sell them as pet quality.: null
    always got to the keep those planted.: null
    amount of people eat, *listen: null
    an awful lot of people know where it is, or have been there.: null
    and jalapeno peppers.: null
    and we, that is getting outside and, doing things they like to do too.: null
    as a course for P E you know: null
    as a rule, it sounds pretty decent,: null
    as an overall package, I'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out.: null
    as far as fun reading, I maybe get to read the Sunday paper, but, that's about it,: null
    as far as spare time, they talked about,: null
    ? as far as, planting outdoor stuff, matter of fact, tonight I just got through,
      I was planting some, some trees out back tonight,
    : null
    as the babies come out they fall down in the trough: null
    as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system,: null
    at first I'm how, why do people like this,: null
    ? at first, when you first have a baby, you, seems to take every moment of your
      time. Partly because you are not used to, juggling your time around like that.
    : null
    at the numbers they, they're kind of outlined and stuff.: null
    back at home I used to have a small, five gallon tank.: null
    basically I'm just,: null
    basically bows and lace: null
    basically it, it was called MUSTANG MAGAZINE: null
    basically, I had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to McKinney is it, Texas,: null
    basically, I, what I did was, I redid the whole interior.: null
    because it's, it's out there.: null
    because they, they like to get in and fertilize things too.: null
    because we have these tow,: null
    before then I was from Utah.: null
    between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood,: null
    bought a few of them.: null
    but nothing steady.: null
    by the time he plays two games a week and I play a game a week, we go to lots of softball .: null
    can't just go out there and say, you guys breed, .: null
    cooking, that's not really a hobby,: null
    course I've been working on it for five years,: null
    decided to take it.: null
    despite the fact that I should be tying flies or fly fishing or, or going for walks in the mountains,: null
    do you have any, do you do any handicraft type things, I think was the question.: null
    down here, it's done both ways.: null
    down the, down the hill here a little ways there are parks that are, look like jungles,: null
    drive my wife crazy.: null
    during Christmas I work on, like, holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things.: null
    during Four H, they really encouraged to do all kinds of crafty stuff, which is in, interesting,: null
    during the summer months it's, occupies quite a bit of my,: null
    during the summer we, we have concerts every Monday night in the park,: null
    during the week they go back and do some more.: null
    enough that, again for anything in the house I could probably,: null
    ? espec, this particular one, I think, was in Maine and New Hampshire, where out
      in the, just kind of out in these little towns they'd be in,
    : null
    especially lately there's been so many babies, that, bibs and blankets, and things like that. Wall hangings,: null
    ? essentially anything you find in a house. a stove, or oven or a broken piece
      of porcelain or, chipped tile on the floor. just anything.
    : null
    even somewhere better,: null

    it could be a flame stitch where so rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or whatever,: null
    it cuts off the, excess seam allowance.: null

    it looks like an air conditioner,: null
    it looks, halfway decent: null
    it makes you understand that, things are different .: null

      to dry in those, those draping bows, those draping streamers.

    that she has a whole bunch of kittens.: null

    that was a real,: null
    that was just the ink,: null
    that was kind of a group: null
    that was kind of for them,: null
    that was, good many, many years ago: null
    that way you can get the feel of,: null
    that went over real well,: null
    that would be great,: null
    that would be great.: null
    that would screw up all the chemical cycles again: null
    that's a beautiful place.: null
    that's a, just a great place. But no Colora, not in Colorado: null
    that's about all the sewing I did,: null

    that's not true.: null
    that's one of those sports I don't go for.: null
    that's probably my problem there.: null
    that's the next project that I'd like to learn to do.: null
    that's usually the team I play on with the tournaments and stuff,: null
    that's what I find in making the dolls and things, that it gives me something that I can create,: null

    that's, that's a change, because there's nine of them that are younger than me.: null
    that's, we have done that.: null
    ? that, I guess, ranges anywhere from, carpentry work to, some types of furniture
      and, I don't know what you would call them, knickknacks, I guess, stuff you
      hang on the wall to put a mirror on
    : null
    that, at least: null
    that, that's what I hate doing is the finishing stuff.: null
    that, that's, that's the part that I don't like, too.: null

    when I was in college I did,: null

    when I was real young I was for a couple,: null
    when I washed them, although I took the precaution of turning them inside out: null

    when you described it, it sounded like something, that would be around, I guess.: null
    when you described it.: null
    when you get it completely, the shell finished, you still have a lot of stuff to do inside,: null
    whenever I go visit my parents, they're always saying, bring some of your tapes .: null
    where my grandmother passed away, but } where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees,: null
    where we are right now there are very few trees.: null
    where you're getting into the delicate work.: null
    whittling or ,: null
    with little ones, I'd be kind of scared , to get anything that has teeth or claws.: null
    work in the garden, work around the yard, of course,: null
    yet I can't do, like, like, craft, on wood.: null
    yet, I think about,: null
    you can get real handy with the hot glue gun.: null
    you can get the little curly hair: null
    you can go to any, a flea market and stuff: null
    you can leave them outside.: null
    you can make fl, dried flower arrangements: null
    you can use all kinds of different, textures of thread.: null
    you can't do top stitching,: null
    you can't see the stitching as much.: null
    you could make the, the granny squares or whatever,: null
    you do find people, into the crafts and the things that, various things for spare time,: null
    you frame them and stuff,: null
    you get into the Vogues,: null
    you get used to it.: null
    you have a little picture of them: null
    you have their birth date on them,: null
    you have to,: null
    you iron that on the T shirt, you paint around it.: null
    you just kind of,: null
    you know one of the books that I did, that I was reading,: null
    you look at those things: null
    you make it in strips.: null
    you put the mother fish in there: null
    you said you did it in the High Sierras.: null
    you said you do a lot of needlework: null
    you said you work, in the gardens too.: null
    you see your fathers do it,: null
    you understand that this was a long time ago.: null
    you weave intricate patterns and use different colors.: null
    ? you will probably find after your children get bigger, like when they want things
      like tricycles, toys, things that cost quite a lot in the store, you can find
      that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few dollars.
    : null
    you'll probably really, re, regain your enthusiasm for it: null
    you're not cramped on these smaller objects.: null
    you, you can either use three or four of the threads.: null
    you, you have to use it in combination with a sewing machine.: null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    A job in itself.: null
    A lot of times you can do that.: null
    As you know, I think it's more like the mess you make, isn't it?: null
    Besides they're fun to grow.: null
    Cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine.: null
    Course that's like that, that, hooking that you were talking about.: null
    Dogs, to me, dogs need a yard, even little dogs.: null
    Especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty,: null
    Especially when they're not quite to the age of understanding that they're hurting,: null
    Fiftyfive gallons, you'd hope it would never do that.: null
    Fun for them.: null
    Give you a little Christmas money, any way.: null
    God this is much better than west Texas.: null
    He wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway .: null
    I can imagine, the longer and longer it goes,: null
    I do not think it is as hard as knitting or: null
    I don't consider it a hobby .: null
    I don't think a cart damages the turf.: null
    I guess I could use a card too.: null
    I guess maybe we've co, covered the topic, pretty good.: null
    I guess that's, that's one way to end a conversation.: null
    I guess they're stoned on the stuff or something.: null
    I guess we're be, recorded.: null
    I guess you could consider that a hobby.: null
    I guess you're kind of young,: null
    I guess, I guess these are going to croak too.: null
    I guess, if you wanted to, you could take classes and learn.: null
    I imagine your life is full: null
    I just think dogs need, need to be outside, though.: null
    I know it's probably late for you,: null
    I know you,: null
    I really don't have any other.: null
    I think I probably would consider that a hobby.: null
    I think afghans and, and the crocheted little sweaters, and, are, are wonderful.: null
    I think crossstitching is so pretty,: null
    I think gluing alone, certainly if you wash it any amount of time, it: null
    I think it is cause I don't get as tired .: null
    I think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch.: null
    I think it's very clever.: null
    I think more the mice or other rodents.: null
    I think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail, probably.: null
    I think that might be true.: null
    I think that still borders on hobby.: null
    I think that will be a lot of fun.: null
    I think that's better than having that party at home .: null
    I think that's really interesting.: null
    I think they're too far away from me,: null
    I think we are suppose to talk for ten minutes: null
    I think we did five minutes,: null
    I think when babies,: null
    I think you're very clever to, sew around the edges.: null
    I think, I think we're okay.: null
    I was going to say because,: null
    I'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that: null
    I'm sure it's just with the, the, the, the way that things are so topsyturvy right now as soon as you dec, decide on a ,: null
    I'm sure you'll get it done,: null
    I'm sure you're familiar with that living,: null
    I, I guess if you make money at it, it becomes a vocation .: null
    I, I think that would be a good family thing: null
    I, I wouldn't if I didn't have this car time ability probably: null
    If you are doing a lot of things, sometimes you have conflicts,: null
    If you can do things together, that really helps a lot.: null
    If you get pleats and all kinds of,: null
    If you, I think if you can do any handicraft, you can learn to crochet.: null
    It gets boring.: null
    It is kind of like when you are a kid and, and someone else's house was fun to clean,: null
    It is not too hard.: null
    It is not, does not sound like an easy one to finish.: null
    It is, an even back then,: null
    It may be a blessing in disguise.: null
    It must be so nice for you, now that you're retired.: null
    It seemed like people did them a lot.: null
    It sounds like her life is full too.: null
    It sounds like you're creative.: null
    It sounds wonderful.: null
    It sure does.: null
    It was, it was relaxing, creative,: null
    It'd be nice to have that.: null
    It's a call.: null
    It's better than, owning on them and making payments on them,: null
    ? It's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how to, to weave the, the
      yarn in between your fingers on your left hand.
    : null
    It's just the same old thing,: null
    It's just too time consuming.: null
    It's just, there's just so many people sewing now days.: null
    It's like, it, it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made .: null
    It's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers,: null
    It's, funny that you said.: null
    It's, it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be.: null
    It, it does take more time.: null
    It, it is just nice to get outdoors and do something.: null
    Keep the kids busy.: null
    Lessons are expensive though.: null
    Not that hard.: null
    Once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear them .: null
    People don't realize it: null
    Pretty good trip.: null
    Probably the same time the, the other squash is though.: null
    Reading is a little bit easier to work around.: null
    Really great,: null
    Seems like sometimes hobbies do that.: null
    Sometimes I think that might not be a bad idea .: null
    T shirt making about covers yours.: null
    That sounds so interesting.: null
    That takes a lot of time.: null
    That will make the summer go by in a hurry.: null
    That's funny.: null
    That's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff.: null
    That's not something you,: null
    That's where a camcorder would come in handy.: null
    That, that would be definitely something you'd want to keep.: null
    There not as likely to as a dog might, I guess.: null
    They are pretty easy.: null
    They just need a yard.: null
    They kind of take over and turn into work instead of: null
    They want things like Himie Persians and Turkish Vans.: null
    Those are pretty.: null
    Those are real popular,: null
    Turkish Vans, if you've never seen one, you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred.: null
    Well you can teach them .: null
    When they start getting rid of technicians,: null
    When you are home: null
    ? Which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take twenty
      thirteen year olds with you, which seems a, a, just a tad more relaxing .
    : null
    You can't just breed them with anything.: null
    You can't just tell them that anyway,: null
    You could learn that, I'm sure: null
    You definitely don't have time.: null
    You get so involved in what you're reading.: null
    You know you have to have something that kind of gets you on the right track of where you're going.: null
    You like it,: null
    You lost an investment: null
    You would have: null
    You wouldn't think that.: null
    a lot of people don't do that either.: null
    actually, the, the Plano, Dallas, Houston, Austin that whole area is, is actually quite, quite nice.: null
    ? actually, what the positions that they found outside of the company were much,
      much better than the ones that they currently had inside.
    : null
    always got to have those.: null
    at least, because I back up to, a hillside where the, wild animals are, I think I can probably justify it.: null
    clothes are getting so expensive now in, in the stores: null
    especially making the seams and things like that it's, it's got such a professional finish on them.: null
    even, even a cat, you never know when they might bite or scratch or something.: null
    fiftyseven's not young,: null
    first one, you know how that is.: null
    gee I guess there really isn't too much to talk about on hobbies.: null
    go, boy, this, this is kind of ugly .: null
    going over that pass is just a real nightmare.: null
    if I could have, if I could make it on the road, I'd like to play on a bluegrass band or something,: null
    if I had a ,: null
    if nobody, if nobody complains you're all right.: null
    if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway.: null
    if you're from Iowa, you must be very artsy crafty.: null
    it can certainly help your finances.: null
    it could be working on cars could be your hobby really.: null
    it doesn't really have to matter,: null
    it gets to where it doesn't bother,: null
    it is it is not going to do that much damage to the course, but apparently they think differently .: null
    it is peaceful,: null
    it is relaxing to do, once you find the time to do it.: null
    it just may not of the original,: null
    it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it,: null
    it keeps all the chemicals in balance.: null
    it reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging, I think.: null
    it really sounds like, a business more than a hobby.: null
    it sure is fun to do that kind of thing because then you have got something to show for it.: null
    it takes a lot of concentration.: null
    it's a cherished commodity now days,: null
    it's a good time for gardening.: null
    it's a necessity.: null
    it's g, it's nice to have it when you're done,: null
    it's healthy, too.: null
    it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it: null
    it's just getting the time to do it .: null
    it's kind of, become an issue you could say.: null
    it's not a very good topic: null
    it's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong.: null
    it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband,: null
    it's really a, a blast.: null
    it's really different because that's kind of the, that's the chalk hills down there,: null
    it's relaxing.: null
    it's so beau,: null
    it's still such better quality that I think it's worth it.: null
    it's such a lost art.: null
    it's the hard work.: null
    it's the wedding season, I guess.: null
    it's, I think it's the greatest stuff in the world, though.: null
    it, it is kind of a nice smell after a while.: null
    it, it looks really po, potent stuff.: null
    it, it really makes it look professional.: null
    it, it's just finding the time for these things that you: null
    just a crummy,: null
    kind of gives you some space for yourself,: null
    kind of your getaway place.: null
    last year he was a little bit young for having one.: null
    looks pretty.: null
    m, most breeders are in it for the money,: null
    maybe this evening anyway.: null
    momentum is, driving force in our lives.: null
    not only can it be fun,: null
    not too many people want Bombays.: null
    now it's a little more expensive to make it, because, y, you start paying the price for the patterns and the material,: null
    obviously not of the original time schedule.: null
    seems like there's just so many things to do down here,: null
    sewing does take up, take an awful lot of time, takes an awful lot of time.: null
    since I'm in an apartment, I just, I don't think an apartment is big enough for a dog.: null
    somebody has to do it,: null
    sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there.: null
    sounds like you,: null
    that always is helpful for starters.: null
    that definitely takes over your time.: null
    that does take some time.: null
    that doesn't leave a lot of time for hobbies,: null
    that is pretty impressive to have three books going.: null
    that sounds interesting.: null
    that sounds really good.: null
    that takes all the work out of it.: null
    that was great.: null
    that's a good place,: null
    that's a great thing to do, really.: null
    that's a hobby in itself.: null
    that's about it down here,: null
    that's an interesting assortment.: null
    that's fun.: null
    that's interesting.: null
    that's kind of interesting hobby.: null
    that's the main .: null
    that's the way life is, I guess.: null
    that's, that's a big step,: null
    that's, that's kind of strange that we got the same call.: null
    the Lions are pretty good, they pro, a lot better team than the Cowboys were today.: null
    the Serger really makes it look professional.: null
    the best thing about it is that you can, try something: null
    the one thing I guess at least in your favor is the, the fact that, that is more in the support of the manufacturing: null
    the time goes by, before you realize anything is going on.: null
    the, the quality is, is sometimes so poor that,: null
    there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people: null
    there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the de, the defense area but manufacturing in general.: null
    there's, there's pluses to everything,: null
    they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk.: null
    they have a way of dragging you back home.: null
    they have some nice stuff down there.: null
    they just, they just breed these, they breed them before they're ready,: null
    they want, privacy fences.: null
    they're just too nice.: null
    they're probably easier than keeping dogs, though, aren't they.: null
    they're probably hardy, harder to take care of: null
    they're sort of Siamese in a way.: null
    they, they do a lot of inbreeding too,: null
    this is your opportunity to do whatever you want,: null
    those are fun to do,: null
    those are so neat.: null
    those are wonderful aren't they.: null
    those take a lot of time.: null
    those things they take some time to make.: null
    we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine.: null
    we're getting to where,: null
    what a great: null
    what, I'm, what I think now is the reason is I kept the tank too clean: null
    when I think of Texas, I think of nothing but, no trees and just grass .: null
    when you die, it's like, when they die it's more like an investment.: null
    with a child it's, kind of stra,: null
    you can pick it up and take it wherever you go.: null
    you can, use crafts to make wonderful things for children.: null
    you do lots of stuff.: null
    you don't get many hand made quilts anymore.: null
    you don't have a lot of time.: null
    you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property.: null
    you end up with, kind of strange kittens.: null
    you felt very creative.: null
    you get rusty.: null
    you got to have a pattern for the body: null
    you have to decide what you enjoy the most.: null
    you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete,: null
    you just can't, can't give up on it,: null
    you just use your right hand with the hook.: null
    you kind of get absorbed in it: null
    you must pay all attention to what you're doing.: null
    you need to let the bacteria build up,: null
    you need to, teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you .: null
    you probably have to clean out the tank too.: null
    you really don't.: null
    you wish so badly that you could do them.: null
    you've got a good attitude about it.: null

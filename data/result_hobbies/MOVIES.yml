      generation,
    : null
    I remember now.: null
    I remember thinking it's a wonderful movie,: null

    I tell you, we really want to go: null
    I tend to, tend to be hypercritical: null
    I think GENERAL HOSPITAL: null
    I think I haven't been to the movie theater here in about, six months,: null
    I think I heard that was just one, was just out.: null
    I think I know who you are talking about though.: null
    I think I read about that too.: null

    I think I'm leaving out a portion.: null
    I think I've made four calls .: null
    I think I've missed one.: null
    I think I've seen most of Humphrey Bogart's movies, but, in, in, a long time ago,: null
    I think ROBIN HOOD, that's it,: null
    I think Roseanne was in it too, another one that if you blink you'd miss her.: null
    I think about these things and people trying to define their own world view,: null
    I think from there on, all the way through the movie.: null
    I think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop.: null
    I think he'd like that one.: null
    I think he's up in a attic, or some part of school.: null
    I think he's very interesting: null
    I think it just says hang up.: null
    I think it was a three hour movie or two and a half hours,: null
    I think it's a hundred years.: null
    I think it's been nominated for twelve awards: null
    I think it's like six bucks now in the theaters,: null
    I think it's put out by Landmark Productions, the same people who put out CHARIOTS OF FIRE.: null
    I think it's, I think, I can think of movies I have less fun during: null
    I think she kept saying that,: null
    I think that was probably the last movie I've seen, too.: null
    I think that's the one I wanted to pick up the other day,: null
    I think that, I can highly recommend that movie this, to see.: null
    I think that, it's, it's kind of good entertainment.: null
    I think the last movie I saw was MISERY.: null
    I think the last movie that we went out to see was DANCES WITH WOLVES.: null
    I think the last one I rented was, MORTAL THOUGHTS: null
    I think the last one that we actually went to go see,: null
    I think there's a bunch of good movies coming out.: null
    I think they are a lot better than they us, than they were,: null
    I think they may be playing up: null
    I think with the rebate you could get it for nine dollars: null
    I think you said Peter.: null
    I think you, it's, it's something I think you would enjoy,: null
    I think, I think the only I've ever seen a sequel was TWO THOUSAND AND ONE.: null
    I think, around here, it's all ready quit playing.: null
    I thoroughly enjoyed it.: null
    I thought I better save that one for another day .: null
    I thought I had to kind of get beyond that.: null
    I thought I'd better see that one before I go and see six.: null
    I thought I'd like it,: null
    I thought an excellent one, too, was MISERY with Kathy Bates and James Caan.: null
    I thought gosh: null
    I thought he did such an excellent job of not: null
    I thought it was good.: null
    I thought it was great.: null
    I thought it was kind of maybe for kids more, than ad,: null
    I thought it was okay.: null

    I thought she was good in that.: null
    I thought that was a good show.: null
    I thought that was a pretty good movie,: null
    I thought that was just great.: null
    I thought that was really funny.: null
    I thought that was so cute,: null
    I thought that would be one of those that I would love to watch over and over.: null
    I thought the book was better than the movie,: null
    I thought the movie was really good as well.: null
    I thought the, the cima, the cinematography was excellent.: null
    ? I thought they made him up, and then I found out, after I saw the movie that,
      they, they started talking about that scandal
    : null
    I thought, I thought it was interesting that he was doing som,: null
    I thought, it, it,: null
    I thought, man .: null
    I thought, my.: null
    I thought, no, it's really funny.: null
    ? I thought, that, that would not have been the sort of thing I would have wanted
      my children to see at that age, when they were young.
    : null
    I thought, what a strange combination,: null
    I told her when she had her, her little girl.: null
    I took a date to it, about a month ago.: null
    I took my kids to see A HUNDRED AND ONE DALMATIANS: null
    I try to get away from that.: null
    I try to say, it's just a movie,: null
    I try to think of myself as young,: null
    I understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television.: null
    I used to do that too,: null
    I used to watch a lot of, sort of, the less, the less popular films.: null
    I usually come away thinking, no I really don't like this show .: null
    I usually rent them .: null
    I usually, when I hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good: null
    I want to go see that.: null
    I want to say Garfield: null
    I want to see AWAKENING.: null
    I want to see WAR OF THE ROSES too,: null

    I wanted to see it.: null
    I wanted to see that .: null
    I wanted to see that.: null
    I wanted, I want: null
    I was WARLOCK too, which is supposed to be the story of a, witch hunt that is, magically shot into the present time.: null
    I was a little disappointed in the third on,: null
    I was a little worried about my son.: null
    I was a lot, I was a lot more impressed with her than I thought I would be.: null
    I was absolutely rolling in the aisles.: null
    I was deciding between that and, MY GIRL: null
    I was going to go see, the Billy Crystal movie, also, which was,: null
    I was going to read while it was on,: null
    I was going to s,: null
    I was going to say, you, you can find certain restaurants that are nice,: null
    I was going, .: null
    I was hesitant,: null
    I was home alone.: null
    I was hoping he was going to get Best Actor.: null
    I was impressed with the fact that, it wasn't that childish.: null
    I was in New York in the sixties.: null
    I was interested in reading TEXASVILLE before I saw the movie.: null
    I was just sit,: null
    I was just sitting there going, my goodness,: null
    I was just sitting there watching it,: null
    I was just thinking another good one I saw not too long ago was, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.: null
    I was kind of surprised at that.: null
    I was listening Sunday night a little bit when,: null
    I was not real impressed with it.: null
    I was pretty disappointed in it.: null
    I was pretty disappointed in that one.: null
    I was ready to go back and see it again,: null
    I was really disappointed in it,: null
    I was really disappointed in that because I like him: null
    I was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it.: null
    I was really happy that he got,: null
    I was really impressed with that one.: null
    I was really surprised.: null
    I was scared to death of our house had a basement for years.: null
    I was telling him about a couple of weeks ago,: null
    I was thinking, Wow,: null
    I was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately, was PRESUMED INNOCENT, with, Harrison Ford,: null
    I was up there half a day and came home and collapsed.: null
    I was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie, because that's, not really the way comedies are right now: null
    I was with my wife: null
    I was worried: null
    I was, I was believing it,: null
    I was, I was pretty disappointed in it: null
    I was, I was so impressed with that movie: null
    I was, I was, I went thinking it'll be okay, not great,: null
    I wasn't sure,: null
    I wasn't, I've seen his other movies,: null
    I watched it at a friend's house on video: null

    ? I went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw DANCES
      WITH WOLVES, which turned out to be an extremely good movie.
    : null
    I went up to do WordPerfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants,: null
    I went with someone,: null
    I went with, our daughter: null
    I won't give the, the whole plot away: null
    I won't tell you that, just in case you see the movie.: null
    I wonder how they kept up with them, though,: null
    I wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction.: null
    I wondered if maybe he was patterned after him.: null
    I wondered who it was too.: null
    I work in Massachusetts actually.: null
    I worked about three days a week ever since, two to three days a week.: null
    I would have gotten in trouble the next day,: null
    I would have liked to have a kid with me, I think, preferably someone seven or eight: null
    I would have, would have liked to have seen it,: null
    I would recommend that if you have a chance.: null
    I'd go which one could that be: null
    I'd have to say, I, I don't know.: null
    I'd heard it was really good, too: null
    I'd like to see GREEN CARD,: null
    I'd like to see SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.: null
    I'd like to see that and, THE NEVER ENDING STORY, came out on Disney this month, I think.: null
    I'd like to see that.: null
    I'd never get my husband to that.: null
    I'd really like to get out to the movies more often.: null
    I'd recommend it.: null
    I'd, I'd a never put those two together.: null
    I'd, I'd rather rent.: null
    I'd, I'd start trying to focus in on people instead of, of picking up the overall,: null
    I'll have to put that, I'll have to keep that on my list then.: null
    I'll have to write that down.: null
    I'll have to write that,: null
    I'll just have to talk about the ones that I went to see,: null
    I'll probably try to go se, to see it in a little while here.: null
    I'll remember the name.: null
    I'll try that.: null

    I'm from New York.: null
    I'm from the .: null
    I'm getting around real good: null

    I'm glad you did that before your surgery .: null

    I'm not sure when it will be hitting video stores,: null
    I'm not too familiar with THELMA AND LOUISE.: null
    I'm not with you so far,: null
    I'm pretty impressed with stuff he's done.: null
    I'm really not for sure, though, if: null
    I'm so sick and tired of that.: null
    ? I'm sure I'm going to be seeing it because in a week to Amarillo where my sister
      lives, and she's got two boys that I took to see the first one.
    : null
    I'm sure I'm going to see the next one here real soon.: null
    I'm sure it was a good movie,: null
    I'm surprised.: null
    I'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on.: null
    I'm trying to think of the other one I saw recently, the one on, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE.: null
    I'm trying to think what else I've seen recently.: null
    I'm trying to think.: null
    I'm trying to,: null
    I'm used to it now.: null
    I'm, I saw her in THE KEYS,: null

    I'm, I'm intrigued by it,: null
    I's about to say, you're not going to take her to that one, I'm sure.: null
    I've been disappointed in some movies that, they don't know how to end it, it seems like,: null
    I've been hearing a lot about it.: null
    I've been on this list for two months.: null
    I've been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it.: null
    I've been wanting to see TURTLE TWO.: null

    I've gone to, one for real live Trek Convention: null
    I've got two.: null
    I've had a hard time enjoying Harrison Ford in anything since the Indiana Jones movies.: null
    I've had somebody tell me that REGARDING HENRY, the Harrison: null
    I've heard a lot about that one.: null
    I've heard a lot of good things about it.: null
    I've heard about that: null
    I've heard it's wonderful too,: null
    I've heard it, it, it's not one for the videos.: null
    I've heard that is wonderful.: null
    I've heard that it's real good.: null
    I've heard that it's real long. That it's a good movie, but it's long, like three hours.: null
    I've heard that's: null
    I've heard that's,: null
    I've heard, I've heard that's really great, though.: null
    I've just been called, by the switchboard,: null
    I've never seen CITIZEN KANE,: null
    I've never seen any of those.: null
    I've never seen either of the first, of the, of the GODFATHER movies: null
    I've never seen that.: null
    I've never, just haven't gone out to see it.: null
    I've only seen him in funny stuff: null
    I've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times.: null
    I've said, I've made four calls,: null
    I've seen HOOSIERS.: null
    I've seen PRETTY WOMAN and DANCES WITH WOLVES,: null
    I've seen all of James Dean's movies.: null
    I've seen it,: null
    I've seen it.: null
    I've seen that,: null
    I've seen that.: null
    I've seen, previews for them on T V,: null
    I've seen, some different clips of it,: null
    I've worked for them for several years, twelve now, I guess.: null
    I've, I've alwa, I've been wanting to see all of it: null
    I've, we've seen that two or three times.: null
    I, I absorbed all of that movie in one sitting.: null
    I, I can see that.: null
    I, I didn't like it.: null
    I, I didn't see that.: null
    I, I didn't, I didn't even like the previews on that.: null
    I, I don't even remember seeing that advertised: null
    I, I don't go to that many: null
    I, I don't know all the actors or anything,: null
    I, I don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every movie he's in.: null
    I, I don't like that a lot.: null
    I, I don't like to go to movies to be scared,: null
    I, I don't mind watching subtitle movies.: null
    I, I don't much care for Michael J Fox anyway.: null
    I, I don't think so.: null
    I, I enjoy them.: null
    I, I feel foolish sometimes because I, I don't speak another language fluently: null
    I, I figure if I find a movie I like, I'll buy it.: null
    I, I guess I have similarly broad tastes.: null
    I, I guess one of my favorite, two of my favorite movies is probably LETHAL WEAPON and LETHAL WEAPON TWO.: null
    I, I had a lot of things that I, I,: null
    I, I hadn't been to the movies for a really long time: null
    I, I have a theory.: null
    I, I have a, a brother myself that's, that's older: null
    I, I have come to respect a little bit more the, what went on here,: null
    I, I have some,: null
    ? I, I have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most,
      that I was really the most in shock with was probably, STAR WARS.
    : null
    I, I haven't seen either one of those.: null
    I, I heard it was really good,: null
    I, I just finally ended up going to see it,: null
    I, I just look at the newspaper before I decide to go: null
    I, I just moved down, in fact, from South Dakota in, in June,: null
    I, I keep a little library of books that I just like to read over and over again: null
    I, I keep forgetting to make these calls.: null
    I, I know for sure that that one about,: null
    I, I know we get discount tickets: null
    I, I like all ranges of movies,: null
    I, I like, I like slapstick comedy.: null
    I, I live alone.: null
    I, I live with, a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us.: null
    I, I loved that film.: null
    ? I, I might have seen part of that because the name sounds familiar although
      I wo, I would remember, I think in, with him in it.
    : null
    I, I never did care for him as, in the James Bond movies.: null
    I, I noticed yesterday in the paper, something said that it,: null
    I, I read a lot of Larry McMurtry books: null
    ? I, I really enjoy watching a movie that, where they don't really try and attract
      the, the great audience, but rather put out a, a real good movie.
    : null
    I, I really enjoyed that.: null
    I, I really like a variety.: null
    I, I really thought about, all the, the westerns that we have seen for years and years,: null
    I, I saw it and, because my wife wanted to see it.: null
    I, I saw the previews.: null
    I, I saw, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.: null
    I, I spent four years traveling around and didn't see, hardly anything.: null
    I, I think lately PRETTY WOMAN'S been my favorite.: null
    I, I think, I liked the other movies he's done.: null
    I, I thought it was a good film.: null
    I, I want to see, DANCES WITH WOLVES.: null
    I, I wanted to see,: null
    I, I was afraid that RAMBO was going to do the same thing that ROCKY was going to do,: null
    I, I was curious if you had seen it: null
    I, I was real disappointed: null
    I, I was really able to, to relate to the, the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers.: null
    I, I was thinking about that too,: null
    I, I was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense: null
    I, I wish, I'd seen it when, when, it was originally in the theaters: null
    I, I wouldn't go so far as being a Trekkie,: null
    I, I'd actually have to get a newspaper out.: null
    I, I'm guessing probably an hour and fortyfive minutes, maybe.: null
    I, I'm not familiar.: null
    I, I'm ready to go.: null
    I, I'm truly enough, I'm truly an intellectual snob,: null
    I, I'm young,: null
    I, I've been down to the south of England where supposedly King Arthur's castle was.: null
    I, I've heard that, and then what you just told me: null
    I, I've really enjoyed him in everything I've seen him in, a guy named Charles Martin Smith.: null
    I, I've seen it twice now .: null
    I, I've seen, , just recently, WHAT ABOUT BOB?: null
    I, I, I had seen it before Christmas,: null
    I, I, I remember that movie,: null
    I, I, I still catch things in AIRPLANE that I didn't catch.: null
    I, I, I tend to, I think, overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great.: null
    I, I, I watched, Costner on the Academy Awards.: null
    I, I, I'm actually originally from Hollywood,: null
    I, I, I've heard lots of good things about it: null
    I, I, I've seen it the second time not too long ago.: null
    I, I, I, I feel that way when movies are blown up, out of proportion,: null
    I, I, I, I have a fiance: null
    I, I, I, I really, I used to watch a fair number of foreign films.: null
    I, I, I, I'm very, I'm very critical,: null
    I, am not one for the,: null
    I, at least what I hear on that one, that it's coming out a second time in a, in a longer version: null
    I, come to think of it, I don't think I went to the movies one time.: null
    I, in that I, I guess I, I hate to be too surprised in a movie,: null
    I, it's just that they are both very long: null
    I, n, I haven't been to South Dakota.: null
    I, now I will copy them and rent them: null
    I, right now I'm working with a temporary agency.: null
    I, then I wasn't expecting any classic either.: null
    I, think because they were, they were scheduling a video release of it in July: null
    I, was reading in, a book. trying to think,: null
    I, we have some doctors at church who said that DOCTOR was just wonderful.: null
    I, we saw her just the other night too.: null
    I, we've rented some videos.: null
    IN SEARCH OF SPOCK, JOURNEY HOME, I think that was.: null
    If I ever get the hankering to see something, I've got, I don't know, maybe about thirty or forty movies: null
    If you are going to be planning on doing that,: null
    In fact we kept sitting there all through the theater going now what, what did that mean,: null
    In fact, I was watching WILD WILD WEST last night: null
    In fact, people I've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards.: null
    In fact, that's where I've seen most of my movies, have been on video.: null
    In fact, the buffalo, the scene, the big buffalo herd scene, that was, that was a live scene.: null
    In one of them they have a mother shark, destroy a whole, marina and aquarium.: null
    It came out right around the time, with Sophia Loren: null
    It doesn't say part one,: null
    It got such bad reviews,: null
    It had a social message to it: null
    It has, w, to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life.: null
    It is about a little kid that, that his parents go off to Paris.: null
    It it's, it's really funny because they run through, what they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives.: null
    It looks, it looks pretty suspenseful.: null
    It made us think.: null
    It really was,: null
    It seems, southern town,: null
    It sounds kind of like one, we saw at home here on the, rented it, CLARA'S HEART.: null
    It this is the first time he's interrupted my phone calls.: null
    It turned out to be a better thriller than I was expecting it to be.: null
    It used to,: null
    It was a different movie from anything I've ever seen.: null
    It was a good show.: null
    It was a little strange,: null
    It was a pretty crowded place.: null
    It was a really, really good movie.: null
    It was about, a,: null
    It was cute,: null
    It was discuss air pollution,: null
    It was fantastic.: null
    It was funny.: null
    It was good.: null
    It was great.: null
    It was horrible.: null
    It was just a good movie.: null
    It was just mostly centered upon his abilities to: null
    It was just too perfect at all times.: null
    It was just,: null
    It was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things.: null
    It was like a FATAL ATTRACTION thing.: null
    It was like the best of the Walt Disney ones.: null
    It was like, want an autograph, want to stand in line for about four hours.: null
    It was not one that I picked,: null
    It was not, not a wonderful film: null
    It was pretty good.: null
    It was pretty scary because I was visiting a V A Hospital, near to where I live: null
    It was pretty wild: null
    It was really good.: null
    It was really kind of interesting because,: null
    It was really sad.: null
    It was really suspenseful.: null
    It was sad, very sad.: null
    It was sad.: null
    It was so awful.: null
    It was telling a friend, I, I said, I only cried twice,: null
    It was the one where he was a defense,: null
    It was very difficult.: null
    It was very predictable,: null
    It was, I, I, it was, it was weird.: null
    It was, it was a big western,: null
    It was, it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic.: null
    It was, it was done fairly well, I think.: null
    It was, it was filmed in Ireland.: null
    It was, it, I was absolutely enthralled by it.: null
    It wasn't Stallone,: null
    It wasn't the same.: null
    It's TRUTH OR DARE: null
    It's a Walt Disney movie: null
    It's a child's movie,: null
    It's a good movie.: null
    It's a little on the violent side: null
    It's about a Black singing group.: null
    It's been a while since I've seen it.: null
    It's called REVIEWING MY LIFE, or something like that.: null
    It's from DANCES WITH WOLVES.: null
    It's just beautiful country with the hills and the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing,: null
    It's just slapstick comedy .: null
    It's just, it's just so realistic. Everything they do.: null
    It's just, just the special effects,: null
    It's no more costly than renting one.: null
    It's not necessarily, it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful.: null
    It's one of my: null
    It's one of our favorite movies.: null
    It's one that, once you've seen it once the suspense there is not really , you really can't see it again: null
    It's playing at school in about two weeks, I guess.: null
    It's probably my all time,: null
    It's really, it was really interesting.: null
    It's sort of the uncut version.: null
    It's supposed to: null
    It's suspenseful.: null
    It's the behavioral science part of communication,: null
    It's very peculiar circumstances: null
    It's with, Jodie Foster.: null
    It's, I don't know, fifteen minutes from the Mass, border and five minutes from the main border. *main = Maine?: null
    It's, he is a prosecuting attorney: null
    It's, it's a neat little story actually.: null
    It's, it's more suspense.: null
    It's, it's over two hours long.: null
    It's, it's pretty deep and, philosophical.: null
    It's, it's pretty graphic at points.: null
    It's, it's very, very good. Very good.: null
    It's, it's, it's a long movie.: null
    It's, the scenery and the landscape and the country that they're in needs a big screen.: null
    It's, uh, story about a little boy in a Italian, a little Italian village,: null
    It, it's just getting so expensive.: null
    ? It, it's just the idea that there is this one spot where the white man has come
      by and killed a bunch a buffalo and just stripped its hide, the hides.
    : null
    It, it's like most suspense movies,: null
    JAGGED EDGE,: null
    Jack Palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy.: null
    Jay really liked ROBIN HOOD.: null
    Jeff Wariner just got out of the hospital: null
    Jeff and Deeanna went and another friend in the neighborhood,: null
    Jessica Tandy won best actress: null
    John is in it if you don't blink.: null
    Just as RAIN MAN, with Dustin Hoffman,: null
    KISS BEFORE DYING.: null
    Keep her on the edge of her seat.: null
    Kevin Costner I understand is supposed to be play Schwartzkopf, supposedly.: null
    Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes: null
    LITTLE MERMAID and PETER PAN: null
    Last thing I saw was, I think, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY with Julia Roberts.: null
    Last year's number one movie for the year was GHOSTS.: null
    Latest, latest one I've saw which was a mistake to go see was LIONHEART,: null
    Like I said, I wouldn't given the supporting actresses either one.: null
    Like I said, we don't take her to R s.: null
    Like you said, you had to accept the beginning of it and just kind of go.: null
    Matter of fact, he looks just as about as old and the, NEXT GENERATION as he does in the latest STAR TREK .: null
    Me and my roommate.: null
    Meanwhile, I sat through the movie and said when are you, when are you supposed to start crying, .: null
    My all time favorite is WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S.: null
    My approach to movies is I kind of hear about them,: null
    My first one was the toughest,: null
    My husband didn't like it that much.: null
    My husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them,: null
    My husband liked that: null
    My husband said it was, about the same lines.: null
    My husband took the kids to see that one: null
    My husband,: null
    My kids are twenty and sixteen,: null
    My kids want to see RESCUER'S DOWN UNDER: null
    My little boy's four: null
    My little boy, he loves ROBO COP.: null
    My son just turned two: null
    My, my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is, EXCALIBUR.: null
    NO WAY OUT was really good: null
    Never sho, any, anyway, anything that I ever wanted,: null
    Nobody had ever touched it before.: null
    None at all.: null
    Normally I'm one of these people that I don't like one, one movie taking all the honors.: null
    Norman Gear.: null
    Norman Gray,: null
    Now I don't, I hardly ever watch T V.: null
    Now I want to see SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.: null
    Now I've seen another clip of, the guy that plays in MURPHY BROWN,: null
    Now as far as, let's say, heavy violence, I can't handle .: null
    Now, I, I also liked, GONE WITH THE WIND or some of the classic, like THE LAWRENCE OF ARABIA: null
    Number nine, number ten, number: null
    OLD YELLER. BIG RED.: null
    Of course I was a teenager when I seen that: null
    Of course the ones I always remember are the, the older ones: null
    Of course they raise them now, to eat.: null
    Of course, the bad thing about it was, the second time I saw it, I didn't really enjoy it as much,: null
    Of course, the only sound is Dudley Moore narrates it.: null
    Of course, they got married: null
    One is SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.: null
    One movie I saw, I guess it was a while back, RED OCTOBER.: null
    One of my favorite movies, it's not one that I haven't seen,: null
    One of those cop thrillers: null
    One, one, absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly, serious subject.: null
    Or what you read.: null
    Other than that, DANCES WITH WOLVES seems like to be the only thing I've seen in the past several months to have any,: null
    Other than the,: null
    P G s used to be R s: null
    PRESUMED INNOCENT was the one we rented,: null
    Parts of, parts of WAR OF THE ROSES was funny: null
    Paul Hogan.: null
    Probably the last comedy we saw, now that I think about it, is HOME ALONE.: null
    Quite frequently, we have our grandchildren on the weekends: null
    Robert De Niro,: null
    SILENCE OF THE LA, of the LAMBS was good.: null
    SILENCE OF THE LAMBS kept me on the edge of my seat.: null
    Saw it just again the other night, for,: null
    She disappeared from her hu, husband who was abusing her.: null
    She doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes.: null
    She goes to almost all movies with us except, R rated.: null
    She gr, she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had, gotten a job as, as an instructor: null
    She said she rented it last night: null
    She was the only indian to have her hair done at all times.: null
    Shoot, I can't remember the guy's name.: null
    Sit there and laugh,: null
    So, sounds sort of like the incredible journey.: null
    Some I know,: null
    Somebody in South Carolina told me about him.: null
    Somewhere in China somewhere I think that it was filmed.: null
    Somewhere in that range.: null
    Speaking of that I think TERMINATOR TWO is supposed to be out.: null
    Stonehenge, of course,: null
    Supposed to be his, his debut in comedy.: null
    TEXASVILLE is just like that.: null
    THE DOORS movie, that's out on video. I want to watch that.: null
    THE LITTLE MERMAID is now our favorite movie.: null
    THE WORLD ACCORDING TO GARP.: null
    THELMA AND LOUISE,: null
    TOTAL RECALL last year I thought was really good, last summer.: null
    Tha, that was a good one too,: null
    That he had stopped writing and had stopped,: null
    That is a riot.: null
    That is one I've been dying to see.: null
    That is their very favorite.: null
    That is what people say.: null
    That kind of reminds me: null
    That made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie I could lay my hands on.: null
    That one little spot in New Hampshire, we have ten miles of coastline,: null
    That scared me to death,: null
    That was a, a great one.: null
    That was a, that was a good one, too.: null
    That was excellent.: null
    That was fun.: null
    That was good.: null
    That was it.: null
    That was just ,: null
    That was kind of a funny movie with, Richard Dreyfuss and Bill Murray.: null
    That was next on our list,: null
    That was on Prime Time Television here, recently at seven thirty in the evening.: null
    That was pretty good.: null
    That was really excellent.: null
    That was supposed to be a true story, too.: null
    That was the first place I ever saw it.: null
    That was the television show.: null
    That was with Richard Dreyfuss.: null
    That was, Robin Williams: null
    That was, that was an excellent movie.: null
    That's exactly what,: null
    That's just one of the many rumors that floats around.: null
    That's kind of how WAR OF THE ROSES was.: null
    That's not a recent movie,: null
    That's one I can watch,: null
    That's pretty good.: null
    That's probably something I need to see right now because I'm taking history in school .: null
    That's probably the last movie I saw. DANCES WITH WOLVES,: null
    That's right.: null
    That's strictly for entertainment .: null
    That's the last one I saw, I think.: null
    That's the, part they had trouble finding was wolves .: null
    That's us too,: null
    That's what I heard,: null
    That's what people said,: null
    That's why I was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part .: null
    That's why, I,: null
    That's, that's on our list of things to see .: null
    That, that's, that's Julia Roberts' new movie.: null
    The French movies that .: null
    The ceilings: null
    The first one was really good.: null
    The five year old doesn't have the attention span, either.: null
    The girl next to me saw it,: null
    The husband was a dentist: null
    The last one they saw was HOME ALONE: null
    The last scary thing I saw was MISERY.: null
    The last two years, I have done more theater movie going than I have actually watched videos at home.: null
    The latest movie I've seen that I thought was fantastic was DANCES WITH WOLVES.: null
    The little guy is so cute,: null
    The oldest daughter, they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of,: null
    The part where they're shooting .: null
    The quality I think maybe has improved in that respect.: null
    The violence can seem very realistic,: null
    The way, you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor.: null
    The, the oldest is nine,: null
    The, the story line,: null
    ? The, the, I guess the, the first, the first, scene in that movie that really
      got my attention, concerning the, the disease and all that was when he, dropped
      the, the, the toothpicks,
    : null
    Then, I saw AWAKENING,: null
    There was a couple of others that are out,: null
    There were parts that were sad.: null
    There're several of them that are out right now that I want to see.: null
    There's a little, an old man who's the projectionist: null
    There's a movie I do want to see,: null
    There's one, there's a movie I've seen, ROGER RABBIT.: null
    They did a lot of stuff that they cut out.: null
    They had a free showing at the Berkeley, United Artist.: null
    They had started out with that,: null
    They had the Disney: null
    They have been doing that.: null
    They have some good management principals in this NEW GENERATION.: null
    They initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised.: null
    They just, just,: null
    They liked it.: null
    They said it was really riveting.: null
    They said it would be up Friday, the, March the fifteenth before it was prepared.: null
    They say if you really want to be, you really want some suspense, that's the one to see.: null
    They sort of move up to levels,: null
    They think they're so cute.: null
    They wanted to watch PRETTY WOMAN, which I have: null
    They was actually went back like they were,: null
    They're eight and ten.: null
    They're supposed to be coming out with all these Desert Storm movies,: null
    They've got, they've got a couple of kids, ten or twelve years old,: null
    This is supposed to be the, the guy that's, replaces Bruce Lee or whatever or,: null
    This was his American film debut: null
    Those little,: null
    Those were the last two that I've seen.: null
    Two and a half . *is this a title??: null
    Unfortunately we don't have any animals,: null
    Valerie Bertinelli.: null
    WHITE PALACE which I thought was over rated, over hyped, recently.: null
    WORKING GIRL is really good.: null
    We don't get to go that often,: null
    We felt guilty for being,: null
    We had both moms and, fifteen year olds and a twelve year old: null
    We had to fast forward through a whole lot of it for them to see it .: null
    We have cable which: null
    We have to dig up a babysitter: null
    We have two children,: null
    We just got through watching one with, is it Claude Van Damme: null
    We just rented, a couple weeks ago, a movie called THE FRESHMAN,: null
    We laughed so hard,: null
    We live right in the corner.: null
    We never quite believed that,: null
    We really need some,: null
    We rent a lot of movies: null
    We rented that one, too.: null
    We saw THE NAKED GUN, TWO AND A HALF: null
    We saw that too,: null
    We seen THE LITTLE MERMAID, too.: null
    We wanted to jump in the cars and race.: null
    We went to see AWAKENINGS: null
    We were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it, too.: null
    We were just all grou, really grouchy when it was over.: null
    We were not responsible,: null
    We will rent two or three movies on Thursday: null
    We'll have to see, because it's, there was some talk about that.: null
    We're just not real big movie goers.: null
    We're not real big movie goers ourselves,: null
    We're really enjoying it: null
    We've been waiting for a, a good movie out this summer for the kids to see.: null
    We've both been wanting to see it.: null
    We've got a good video place out here: null
    We've got two bathrooms: null
    We've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months.: null
    We've taken her from real young,: null
    We, I think the last one we saw was, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES PART TWO.: null
    We, we laughed about it .: null
    We, we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever .: null
    We, we saw, an, we liked it: null
    When I was a little kid, I saw the INCREDIBLE JOURNEY on Christmas Eve: null
    When it was,: null
    When that first came out, I really did not expect the special effects or anything like that.: null
    Where he plays a, a actor that's, th,: null
    Which was an interesting movie, but not very funny.: null
    Whoopi Goldberg.: null
    William Shatner wrote it.: null
    With that new, Michael J Fox movie, THE HARD WAY.: null
    With, Anthony Quinn.: null
    Yes they like your Lewis much to the chagrin of sophisticated Am, of sophisticated American everywhere.: null
    You can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie.: null
    You just can't go out the front door honey,: null
    You know, that I read in PEOPLE or somewhere, it was U S A TODAY: null
    You listen to him: null
    You see it for, a couple of hours or an hour: null
    You start hearing noises: null
    You wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things.: null
    You're bringing it,: null
    a couple years ago, I guess, maybe ten years ago I, I had read: null
    a defense and a prosecution,: null
    a friend of mine saw it: null
    a friend of mine told me she got NAKED GUN last night: null
    a good bit of that was filmed right in Cincinnati.: null
    a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape.: null
    a lot of things we try to catch at the dollar theater or matinees: null
    a lot of times I'll wa, I'll start watching a movie: null
    a lot of times they have the, the, the, international films downtown: null
    a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something: null
    a lot of times, what I wind up doing is, picking say an actor or an actress,: null
    a review usually won't make me go see a movie I hadn't already wanted to see.: null
    actually have been to the movies,: null
    after BULL DURHAM and FIELD OF DREAMS,: null
    after that he did fine.: null
    after the movie's over, I remember it so terribly well: null
    after, after that I get involved in other things and don't want to: null
    all of a sudden I'm saying I wish I'd bought these things.: null
    all the critics initially said that, it wouldn't go anywhere, that it was just going to be a dud.: null
    all the other animals.: null
    all twelve,: null
    amateurs but really quite good.: null
    and the music: null
    and using makeup and using the: null
    and, WHAT ABOUT BOB?: null
    another movie I watched.: null
    another prosecutor in the, a woman prosecutor in there is murdered: null
    anyhow we got, we got a nice, picture: null
    anything that's, has anything: null
    anyway, that was a French movie: null
    as I say, th, I prefer the light movies that,: null
    as it turns out, they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that.: null
    ? as the movie settles down to a comfortable action, I can't really that it would
      have gotten more than a star and a half from me either.
    : null
    ask me to name the ten that are out there right now,: null
    at first they told me.: null
    at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in.: null
    back in his early days, he, he, he had things,: null
    basically he played, a Frenchman who married an American girl, in a marriage of convenience: null
    because I was going to say I always enjoyed that,: null
    because of the cost: null
    ? because she could claim she was married, she could get, an apartment or a condominium
      in a very exclusive building in New York that had a garden, an, an, an outside
      garden, which is very unusual there.
    : null
    because, everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying to, to imitate them or whatever.: null
    because, the little boy dies.: null
    being from Baltimore, of course, I'm a big Barry Levinson fan since, he, he's, he's done a bunch of Baltimore movies.: null
    boy, I can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out.: null
    boy. He was, he, he gave the, the best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN.: null
    by the end he was looking more like a cop.: null
    couple weeks ago I rented it and, watched it: null
    course I am a Kevin Costner fan.: null
    course, here's this, this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around.: null
    course, it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her: null
    do you know that I don't follow performers,: null
    don't have a job: null
    don't really know,: null
    earlier tonight we were watching TO LIVE AND DIE IN L A.: null
    especially if there's commercial in it .: null
    ev, eventually it comes out on video,: null
    even the ones that we rent at home, the trouble with some of them I know,: null
    even though they were okay, the girl in it,: null
    even worse, he directed it.: null
    every major city had one theater that did it: null
    every once in a while, I go, but it, it has to be somebody that I like: null
    every room leads to three rooms,: null
    every time he left the Enterprise, everything went to hell.: null
    everyone else watched it .: null
    everyone feels they are totally retarded.: null
    excellent acting by Billy Crystal and: null
    excellent movie.: null
    ? finally they, carried her, out into the courtyard to, to, either really to shoot
      her or to go through the motions of, of shooting her, with by firing, executing
      her by firing squad.
    : null
    finally, it's my first summer movie .: null
    ? finally, through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different
      people embarrassed enough of the, the middle, bureauc, bureaucracy that they
      finally let her go.
    : null
    for a while, sometimes they come in a whole bunch of them that just,: null
    ? for, for, for no real, direct reason, I guess, we, we get into, a really good
      relationship for a while and then, back and forth
    : null
    friend and I went to see OUT FOR JUSTICE: null
    from what I heard, the guy who got it was better,: null
    from where I'm at.: null
    further down the coast in Massachusetts they got hit pretty bad.: null
    go rent it.: null
    gosh, I know, the one with the two girls that take off from, a, across, across the country on a crime spree.: null
    gosh, I'm just trying to think of all the movies I've recently seen.: null
    had Claude Van Damme.: null
    has Jeff Bridges and, and, Robin Williams.: null
    has Robert DeNiro in it.: null
    have you seen any movies recently?: null
    haven't, haven't been to one for a little while,: null
    he and my husband and I, we just sit there and cackle: null
    he at least saw it one time .: null
    he befriends this old man,: null
    he bought me PRETTY IN PINK.: null
    he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp.: null
    he certainly didn't,: null
    he chose it: null
    he could climb out the window .: null
    he deserts and goes to New York: null
    ? he did real good through the whole movie except the part where the dogs are
      sending the message, that the, the, the puppies are missing
    : null
    he didn't go back for more,: null
    he didn't want to listen to it.: null
    he directed the one before, I think STAR TREK FOUR, something like that.: null
    he does, he has a talk show on the, K L I F.: null
    he ended up being accused of it.: null
    he got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with oreo cookies .: null
    he got killed.: null
    he got scared,: null
    he had murdered her.: null
    he has a fetish for Oreo cookies.: null
    ? he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo we, my dad has got a little plane,
      we flew over it all a, looked at the buffalo,
    : null
    he has to go underground,: null
    he he turns out to be a law man.: null
    he is still alive: null
    he is up in the attic asleep because he got in trouble.: null
    he just a little freckly, little boy.: null
    he just bawled at the end: null
    he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow.: null
    he just, to me, is not a very dynamic actor.: null
    he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house,: null
    he likes to rent them: null
    he looks like little, I don't know, he looks like a little boy next door,: null
    he loves them.: null
    he made kind of an odd sounding ROBIN HOOD,: null
    he moves on to L A to where that, where she is to just help him out.: null
    he only saw it one time,: null
    he played the, the, the character in it that was very, gross, very dirty,: null

    he rescues this, bald eagle: null
    he rides through the clouds,: null
    he runs around a lot.: null
    he said gosh, you're just healing really well,: null
    he said something, because his English was so poor on, for the most part,: null
    he said, I'll wait until it comes out on, tape and rent, rent the video.: null
    he said, realistically ,: null
    he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks.: null
    he says, yeah,: null
    he sets up traps for them all over the house.: null
    he shaved the beard off.: null
    he signed it.: null
    he speaks very broken English.: null
    he starts dreaming: null
    he starts out by fighting to make money,: null
    he thought ROBIN HOOD was great.: null
    he told them, remember , remember, you were united, you can succeed, individually you will fail: null
    he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done.: null
    he wa, before he saw the movie he was disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this .: null
    he wanted to see that.: null
    he wants to see that: null
    he was a prosecu, cuter.: null
    ? he was a, a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the, on the streets and sort
      of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer,
    : null
    he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image.: null

    he's going through a stage right now where he's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can: null
    he's going to be in also.: null
    he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff.: null
    he's never made an American film.: null
    he's nice looking,: null
    he's playing a cop.: null
    he's running into Marlon Brando who is playing, this Maf, this, organized crime head.: null
    he's saving the land of,: null
    he's singular I guess,: null
    he's sixteen.: null
    he's supposed,: null
    he's terribly rich by now.: null
    he's the director,: null
    he's this actor, right: null
    he's trying to find it,: null
    he's trying to save the land from some, .: null
    he's, a very odd, odd man: null
    he's, he was a real psycho in the movie.: null
    he, he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody: null
    he, he said he enjoyed it: null
    ? he, he was so proud of himself for giving ex, all the correct answers that,
      that on the last one he said, I never remember that answer
    : null
    he, he's kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway.: null
    he, he, once he has one he likes, he likes to watch it over and over.: null
    he, in fact, he didn't direct this one.: null
    he, owns a,: null
    he, the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards, .: null
    he, the, he was, he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that.: null
    her dad was a doctor: null
    her husband had escaped to Hong Kong,: null
    her, her time frame was prior to the nineteen fortynine revolution.: null
    here in Texas we only get two channels,: null
    here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the T V.: null
    here, here's another one that I've seen.: null
    his family, they lived in the same house there,: null
    his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream, like HAIR SPRAY.: null
    his wife's all excited: null
    his, his, his karate is pretty good.: null
    his, it kind of shows how his, best friend, this little girl, deals with his death: null
    i, they're coming out with a sequel to it.: null
    ? if I am looking for entertainment usually I, I, have more, time in the evening
      than I do in the middle of the day to, see things.
    : null
    if I could remember the name, I know you'd know his name, because he's played in a few movies.: null
    if I take a date,: null
    if I, if I know the topic I'll go ahead and accept it as mine,: null
    if and when we ever get a babysitter, like we did with SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, we go see it.: null
    if you accept a few of the basic starting points, I guess the rest falls in place.: null
    if you don't mind reading subtitles,: null
    if you like love stories, it's sweet.: null
    if you want popcorn and stuff: null
    if, if that is that the second one follows the first.: null
    impressed with: null
    in STAR MAN, he was the guy chasing after, Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen, or Nancy Allen.: null
    in fact I guess this was the last movie I saw: null
    in fact she told me, Mom if we have a little girl and she has red hair we're naming her Aerial.: null
    in fact we have a ten year old grandson that,: null
    in fact, I want to, rent it when it comes out for my husband to see,: null
    in fact, I'm not even familiar with it,: null
    in fact, I, I, I'll, I'll look for it because I ,: null
    in fact, Thing has a big, much bigger role than he does in the series.: null
    in fact, a friend from Germany was visiting in March: null
    in fact, it got some pretty serious deep parts in it: null
    in fact, it's funny.: null
    in fact, that was advertised not too long ago.: null
    in his classes they're using, there's a bun, they're running a bunch of scenes from THE GODFATHER: null
    in some of those, they, I guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about Lebanese and, and, and,: null
    in that one you could, you could pretty well guess where it was,: null
    in the case of TWIN PEAK a little, there's some elements of the supernatural in it, too.: null
    in the early eighties or the, during the, the SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT era.: null
    in the first scene, the warlock chopped off a guy's finger because he wanted the ring and then: null
    in the meantime, she and her husband, were ex, ex, were expecting a child, their own child.: null
    in the middle of that conversation we sort or picked an, an interesting point.: null
    in the movie she, she disables him, but not by cutting his feet.: null
    in the sixties.: null
    in this movie, this, there's this boy: null
    in time, the, all the side effects started showing.: null
    in, in the book apparently she cuts his feet off,: null
    is reborn to the younger generation,: null
    it came in an envelope that says DANCES WITH WOLVES: null
    it came out I guess about a month or, about a month and half ago, something like that.: null
    it came out in the theater.: null
    it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother.: null
    ? it didn't get as, as good a reviews as the LITTLE MERMAID, their last one, and
      got all kinds of Academy Awards and things last year.
    : null
    it doesn't end like the story has been going.: null
    it flies through the air.: null
    it gets to where he can't, control his movements at all.: null
    it gets you,: null
    it had an excellent story line.: null
    it had large, press release.: null
    it is six dollars,: null
    it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling,: null
    it just ran the gamut of emotion.: null
    it just tells about their friendship that lasts through all these years.: null
    it just wasn't as funny the second time: null
    it kept going on: null
    it looked to me like it was a real submarine,: null
    it made me think a lot about,: null
    it makes you feel really sorry for her.: null
    it put me in a really, it put me in a really bad mood,: null
    it really is .: null
    it really is,: null
    it really keeps: null
    it really kind of had a turn at the end, when you found out who it was .: null
    it really wasn't on a theme that I was, that into,: null
    it says when the conversation is over just say your goodbyes and hang up.: null
    it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast.: null
    it seemed to be the custom up there.: null
    it should be a while yet, though.: null
    it shows the town,: null
    it sound kind of nice,: null
    it sounds ki,: null
    it starred, that, that it's Albert Brooks,: null
    it starts off with like a tic,: null
    ? it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids if they
      had included all this stuff that, I, as an intellectual adult would appreciate,
    : null
    it turned out to be a very cute movie.: null
    it was Michael Douglas.: null
    it was THE PRINCESS BRIDE.: null
    it was a book before it came out in a movie,: null
    it was a fun movie to watch.: null
    it was a, a genre that I wasn't in the least bit interested in,: null
    it was actually better than the first one, I thought.: null
    it was all bloodless: null
    it was also right along the same lines.: null
    it was an enjoyable movie.: null
    it was an interesting movie.: null
    it was called the DELLS,: null
    it was called, HARD WAY, where he was an actor, trying to portray: null
    it was classic TREK.: null
    it was excellent.: null
    it was familiar your accent.: null
    it was filmed right outside of Pierre.: null
    it was fine for her: null
    it was great,: null
    ? it was hard to accept that, this, multimillionaire wheeler dealer would, would,
      find himself and allow himself to get into that situation.
    : null
    it was him, but with a: null
    it was his, his,: null
    it was it was a, it was a mystery.: null
    it was just enter, all around entertaining.: null
    it was just so real, realistic and lifelike and good animation.: null
    it was just so realistic.: null
    it was just,: null
    it was just, it was a lot of music a lot of old songs, things like that.: null
    it was just, you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing: null
    it was kind of cute.: null
    it was kind of fun.: null
    it was kind of gross, kind of like, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS,: null
    it was kind of like just about their,: null
    it was kind of,: null
    it was late at night and scary .: null
    it was like this ho, big house had a basement,: null
    it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it: null
    it was on T V recently, FATAL ATTRACTION.: null
    it was on a higher level, where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did,: null
    it was on one of the networks, I think last weekend.: null
    it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out.: null
    it was one of those that has a lot of twists in it,: null
    it was probably here and gone fairly quickly.: null
    it was quite an experience: null
    it was really good.: null
    it was really neat.: null
    it was something like discuss pollution.: null
    it was still so well done: null
    it was the,: null
    it was the, it's one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.: null
    it was too long: null
    it was very serious, very se,: null
    it was very, very difficult.: null
    it was within, ninety days.: null
    it was worth the buck I guess.: null
    it was, it w, it was a drama.: null
    it was, it was a lot of people said it was a really funny movie,: null
    it was, it was all right, kind of funny.: null
    it was, it was believable.: null
    it was, it was called MANHUNTER, actually.: null
    it was, it was entertaining,: null
    it was, it was interesting .: null
    it was, it was okay.: null
    it was, it was pretty telling about the, the, the F B I and their procedures.: null
    it was, it was really fas,: null
    it was, it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed,: null
    it was, it was saying don't do STAR TREK management style.: null
    it was, it was unimpressive to look at.: null
    it was, it was,: null
    it was, it was, in the,: null
    it was, it was, it was cute but not the biggest laugh I've seen.: null
    it was, that was the last one I saw downtown,: null
    it was, what I liked about it was that it was a new subject.: null
    it was. Because we're here eighteen years: null
    it wasn't .: null
    it wasn't a bad movie.: null
    it wasn't a mystery,: null
    it wasn't anything spectacular.: null
    it wasn't something that I would enjoy seeing twice or three times.: null
    it wasn't, blood and guts and violence and, and car chases type thing.: null
    it wears off.: null
    it worked out.: null
    it would have to be a good show.: null
    it's , it's obnoxious,: null
    it's GODFATHER THREE.: null
    it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in: null
    it's a cute movie.: null
    it's a funny movie.: null
    it's a good movie,: null
    it's a huge eagle, wing span of twenty feet or something like that.: null
    it's a matinee,: null
    it's a precious movie,: null
    it's a very good movie: null
    it's a, I guess it's a mystery, you'd call it.: null
    it's a, it's a mystery.: null
    it's about Al Capone's brothers.: null
    it's about a man, that, leaves his home and comes back to his wife,: null
    it's about this little boy who,: null
    it's about, Jesuit community in, at the Inca Falls in, in, South America, Northern Argentina.: null
    it's an excellent movie.: null
    it's animated.: null
    it's been about five minutes.: null
    it's been on cable,: null
    it's been out for a couple of years,: null
    it's been out for a while.: null
    it's been probably a month or so since I've been to the movies.: null
    it's been so long since I: null
    it's been so long since I've seen it.: null
    it's been, it's been a couple of months.: null
    it's called .: null
    it's fixing to come out on video: null
    it's got Matthew Broderick in it and, Marlon Brando.: null
    it's got a good historical perspective to it.: null
    it's got this wonderful French actor who's,: null
    it's got, Cheech .: null
    it's gotten so expensive that we: null
    it's hard for me to get to movies now because it's getting so expensive,: null
    it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies.: null
    it's hilarious too, especially with that, little guy in it.: null
    it's interesting.: null
    it's just I haven't had the time to go to the movies lately .: null
    it's just a movie,: null
    it's just been down here a couple weeks, I think.: null
    it's just really an incredible thing.: null
    it's just, glued to the T V all the time anyway.: null
    it's just, just amazing, amazing picture.: null
    it's just, shoot the Indians,: null
    it's kind of,: null
    it's kind of, it's an action adventure kind of, shoot 'em up kind of film.: null
    it's kind of, kind of a poor man's PRETTY WOMAN in reverse.: null
    it's not a late movie.: null
    it's not crowded: null
    it's not cutesy.: null
    it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it.: null
    it's not my all time favorite movie: null
    it's on video now, I think.: null
    it's one of those things.: null
    it's only about, half an hour.: null
    it's pretty entertaining,: null
    it's pretty good,: null
    it's really good,: null
    it's really good.: null
    it's really interesting: null
    it's really interesting that,: null
    it's really silly that I enjoy him a lot: null
    it's really worth it.: null
    it's so close,: null
    it's still on, to the best of my knowledge.: null
    it's still out now,: null
    it's supposed to be a real scary one .: null
    it's sweet,: null
    it's the story of this little cat and dog: null
    it's usually pretty good,: null
    it's very, it's really disturbing but a good movie.: null
    it's was a night out, away from the children.: null
    it's with Sean Young.: null
    it's with women in it instead of men: null
    it's, I think it's less than two hours.: null
    it's, hasn't worked out that way yet.: null
    it's, it looks good,: null
    it's, it was, it was advertised over a period of about ninety days.: null
    it's, it's a, it's an adaptation of the, of the Shakespeare play,: null
    it's, it's an excellent movie,: null
    it's, it's an odd film: null
    it's, it's different,: null
    it's, it's fun, it's a fun thing to do to get out and: null
    it's, it's kind of funny.: null
    it's, it's one of the reasons why, THE GODFATHER's been on our minds lately.: null
    it's, it's really a good movie.: null
    it's, it's something that,: null
    it's, it's, it's hard to say.: null
    it's, you can always count on her to watch something like that .: null
    it, it did show some, some, some interesting things about the F B I: null
    it, it didn't scare me all that much,: null
    it, it gets very difficult to,: null
    it, it had, Fred Savage in it.: null
    it, it was a big breakthrough,: null
    it, it was a film of her concert, tour she had taken through all, all around the world.: null
    it, it was a real good movie.: null
    it, it was like pulling teeth to go get him to, to see it: null
    it, it's F slash X.: null
    it, it's pretty good.: null
    it, it, it had people,: null
    it, it, it sort of showed two different types of tribes: null
    it, it, it varies,: null
    it, they're flying all over with it.: null
    ju, ju, just for that reason, it is a, it does cost a lot,: null
    just every time I would start to get into the movie, and it was getting good: null
    just finger hopping.: null
    just kind of, kind of go out and, rent all the movies and, just kind of go,: null
    just recently I've been to a couple .: null
    just the one,: null
    just the other night on H B O we watched THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER,: null
    kind of dark,: null
    kind of gory and lots of,: null
    kind of had the feeling along that,: null
    last week, as a matter of fact, my children was on Spring Break: null
    let's see, there's a couple or three that I would like to go see before they go into videos.: null
    like RAMBO and all that.: null
    like you said, I, I enjoy the comedies a lot better.: null
    lot of times we don't answer the phone, probably when I get mine: null
    maybe I just laughed so hard the first time that I didn't have it,: null
    maybe it will come out this fall.: null
    maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time. I had laughed so hard I was hoarse.: null
    me too, because I don't even know if I could live through it now.: null
    mo, movie prices up here: null
    most of them were twenty or so: null
    mostly we wait until they come out on video tape,: null
    movie theatres here, they are six dollars, for evening performances.: null
    movies are very expensive.: null
    movies like that scare me, though.: null
    my V C R went on the blitz about two weeks ago,: null
    my boyfriend and I went to see MY GIRL.: null
    my brother lives over in Fort Worth,: null
    my dad lives in the state capital, which is Pierre: null
    my daughter is twelve: null
    my daughter went to see that one too.: null
    my daughter's five,: null
    my daughter's in love with the LITTLE MERMAID: null
    my face hurt so bad,: null
    my family tells me that, that, that it had been actually in the house before .: null
    my father works in films: null
    my house kind of looks like two trailers put together.: null
    my husband and I had this great desire to go see a comedy: null
    my husband bought me, I think PRETTY IN PINK for my birthday.: null
    my husband does that.: null
    my husband dragged me to it.: null
    my husband is a movie fanatic.: null
    my husband keeps wanting to.: null
    my husband wants to see that one,: null
    my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me,: null
    my husband's from New Jersey,: null
    my husband's name is Bob: null
    my husband, sometimes, he'll receive a call: null
    my kids are going to their Dad's tomorrow night: null
    my kids both saw that.: null
    my kids weren't in the roo,: null
    my kids' very favorite, and yours may be too young for it, was HOME ALONE.: null
    my little boy just turned four.: null
    my little girl is three months old: null
    my mom saw that: null
    my most recent, movie that I, that I liked a lot, not my most recent movie, was HENRY THE FIFTH.: null
    my one grandson and I,: null
    my parents took me when I was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamie's age .: null
    my preference is the one we saw before that was SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.: null
    my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer, on, choir tour and: null
    my style of entertainment is, is comedy, primarily: null
    my wife can't understand it,: null
    my wife enj, she likes the suspense movies.: null
    my wife took, I think the kids to see that one,: null
    ? my wife's from down in that region around the s, the, called the, the Seven
      Missions which are, which are right down in this, where I'm sure where it was
      filmed at.
    : null
    my wife, has got a, a picture from Kevin Costner: null
    my, my favorite movie of all time has been, THE MISSION.: null
    my, my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago,: null
    my, my kids are just small babies: null
    my, my, my movie watching has, has, severely, has, has changed a lot since I got married.: null
    never seen, I've never seen CASABLANCA and never seen GONE WITH THE WIND.: null
    no one knew that.: null
    nobody told me that it was all fake.: null
    normally we don't think about it until,: null
    not all time favorite,: null
    not too often.: null
    nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship .: null
    nothing, nothing, of course, serious is wrong with him: null
    now I ha, I haven't seen THE TERMINATOR movie,: null
    now that I think back on it, I'd say yeah, I can't believe that either.: null
    now these are for two very different movies.: null
    now we did go see HOME ALONE at the dollar movie: null
    oddly enough, I do too,: null
    of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that.: null
    of course sometimes they rent movies and, have friends over or something.: null
    of course they wanted to see it.: null
    of course, I enjoyed those good guy, bad guy type conflicts things.: null
    of course, I get to watch all these movies like LOOK WHO'S TALKING and WHO'S, LOOK WHO'S TALKING, TOO: null
    of course, I was, I was living alone at the time: null
    of course, a bunch of girls had told me and warned me,: null
    of course, she had to walk.: null
    ? of the, of the few good things that were in it, it did show, a lot about the
      F B I. About the training, and, and how they go through training and how they
      try to, to develop, a mental picture of who they're looking for before they
      go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that.
    : null
    on all the, the advertisements Arnold Schwarzenegger says he doesn't kill anybody in the movie.: null
    on on on, all this wonderful mess: null
    on that order.: null
    on the one hand I'd like it to be a warning,: null
    ? on the other hand I wouldn't want people who currently get sort of enjoy their
      violence fixes from these movies to start thinking gee, now we want to see the
      aftermath all the time either.
    : null
    on the other hand, I'm not sure I would have gone otherwise,: null
    on the other hand, given that my wife likes those, I, I, I occasionally like to watch them: null
    on the, on the whole, it was pretty similar. And, a lot of fun.: null
    once I was there, I couldn't believe.: null
    one bathroom is at the end of one side: null
    one day my husband had the kids: null
    one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.: null
    one of my favorites,: null
    one of my friends who went to see SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, and she told me to go.: null
    one of the movies we saw recently, we saw, MISERY.: null
    one of them was lost for many, many years: null
    one person at work I know gets really into those goofy horror flicks: null
    one was a warring tribe,: null
    one's in the middle of the other,: null
    other than it was a chop them up movie.: null
    other than that I just didn't have time to go to the movies,: null
    other than that I've heard the, the, the, the scenery in it: null
    other times it was like it was just deadly serious,: null
    our big thing is,: null
    our movies today, it used to be X: null
    our time is scarce.: null
    out of a piece of paper, they can kill somebody,: null
    outside of that, rent a lot,: null
    over time she,: null
    partly it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book: null
    people call in: null
    people were just screaming and applauding: null
    people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me .: null
    perhaps, perhaps it's unfair, because I, I, I must admit I enjoy these movies: null
    popcorn is not that expensive.: null
    reading the little words at the bottom of the screen: null
    really, really good show.: null
    recently I, I've seen, the FISHER KING.: null
    right before I went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on,: null
    right now Kevin Costner, he's starring in everything.: null
    said it was real good: null
    saw THE ADDAMS FAMILY last week.: null
    see, I haven't seen that one,: null
    ? several years back one we saw, we saw we really, really enjoyed was, ORDINARY
      PEOPLE, with, Timothy Hutton and, Mary Tyler Moore,
    : null
    she did, years later when the, liberalization, in real life: null
    she does real good.: null
    she fakes her death kind of thing: null
    she falls asleep .: null
    she feel madly in love with this writer.: null
    she figures out this way to, to leave him secretly.: null
    she goes all the time: null
    she had a baby.: null
    she has a suit against his company.: null
    she just thinks the grou,: null
    she liked it: null
    she made him go sleep upstairs.: null
    she played a,: null
    she played in, narrow margin which was a little more recent,: null
    she pretended to be the boss or something.: null
    she put in to go see him.: null
    she really enjoyed it,: null
    she really liked it.: null
    she really likes all these gory: null
    she said it was okay,: null
    she said that was an excellent movie.: null
    she said that was hilarious.: null
    she says her little girl's into it now.: null
    she understood everything.: null
    she was a horticulturist,: null
    she was a killer,: null
    she was a very svelte, sophisticated urban New Yorker: null
    she was not persecuted or anything else like that.: null
    she wat, she watches these really gross things like,: null
    she'll even watch things like karate movies and stuff like that.: null
    she's a housekeeper: null
    she's a housekeeper.: null
    she's also ,: null
    she's his biggest fan: null
    she's planning ahead,: null
    she's sort of Schwarzenegger fan type of.: null
    she, as she grew up towards maturity, her parents,: null
    she, her life was spared.: null
    she, she breaks both of his ankles.: null
    she, she does really good.: null
    she, she likes, action movies and, and, and comedies: null
    she, she put in for going, going to,: null
    she, she went across the border to her husband and another, and other child that they'd already had: null
    she, we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that.: null
    shoot, I'm going to hit myself after I hang up.: null
    short nerdy guy with glasses.: null
    ? since he had this friend up from Houston, and his friend had already seen so
      many and I thought they decided on this and I thought I want to see this one,
      too.
    : null
    so sometimes we stick with the stuff we've heard more about than,: null
    some I don't.: null
    some friends called up and said do you want to go see this movie,: null
    some of the different things we're doing,: null
    somebody made an interesting observation,: null
    somebody was recommending it to somebody.: null
    somehow just never made it to see that,: null
    someone had,: null
    someone said that was a lot of fun to go do.: null
    sometimes movies are here that I did not, I am not even aware that I could have seen,: null
    starring Kevin Costner,: null
    th, that's what I heard, too.: null
    that I couldn't watch,: null
    that came out, early in the summer or something like that.: null
    that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers.: null
    that comes on different channel.: null
    that could really happen.: null
    that horse has been such a pal to him,: null
    that is true for Ellison.: null
    that is, it,: null
    that is, that is the most precious movie.: null
    that kind of bothered him: null
    that makes sense.: null
    that might be good, though,: null
    that might be good.: null
    that movie, I have to, I'll fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is,: null
    that one is definitely worth seeing,: null
    that one sounded gross,: null
    that rolling kind of,: null
    that they said they weren't going to do anymore.: null
    that was THE TERMINATOR: null
    that was a good show I thought,: null
    that was a lot of fun.: null
    that was a riot to see that.: null
    that was a well directed and acted movie.: null
    that was an excellent movie.: null
    that was around the time of anniversary,: null
    that was cute,: null
    that was excellent.: null
    that was great.: null
    that was interesting.: null
    that was just hilarious,: null
    that was kind of another suspense type, Alfred Hitchcock type thriller.: null
    that was kind of interesting.: null
    that was made in a few, I don't know, several years back, I guess.: null
    that was one of my favorites,: null
    that was one that, that stayed with me: null
    that was one where,: null
    that was one, Jay got to see with a friend: null
    that was pretty good.: null
    that was pretty scandalous.: null
    that was real, that was a good one.: null
    that was so good.: null
    that was so that he couldn't leave her,: null
    that was something for greedy old me at Christmas time, I'll tell you.: null
    that was sort of her dream.: null
    that was, that was, what the, much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman.: null
    ? that was, that, that helped us sort of feel good about, about ourselves and
      about one around us, in that at least, at least, if everyone's running around
      seeing karate movies and stuff like that, at least they're still going to see
      the real good movies,
    : null
    that was, that, that might be one of my all time favorites too,: null
    that wasn't a real submarine you saw in the water.: null
    that wasn't it.: null
    that way you can watch it at your leisure.: null
    that won best picture, I think.: null
    that would be kind of hard for us,: null
    that's a good one to put on the list.: null
    that's a tearjerker: null
    that's about all the movies I've seen recently .: null
    that's about all the time I can, I can spare.: null
    that's all they'd have to do .: null
    that's all we get,: null
    that's also on my list.: null
    that's another one I wanted to see.: null
    that's at least the good thing about the Texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper.: null
    that's close,: null
    that's coming back, on too .: null
    that's just for a bok, a bucket of popcorn,: null
    that's just something I just don't want to watch.: null
    that's kind of the: null
    that's my husband's all time favorite, I think.: null
    that's no cartoons for my little boy.: null
    that's not why I go: null
    that's on my list to see.: null
    that's one I have watched, six or eight times.: null
    that's one of them.: null
    that's one we want to see.: null
    that's out on video now: null
    that's pretty good: null
    that's pretty much what I do.: null
    that's right.: null
    that's something I really should have seen.: null
    that's something I want to see,: null
    that's the one I was thinking of.: null
    that's the one, that is the honest to God the one reason I don't want to see the movie: null
    that's the one.: null
    that's the other one that we went to that night.: null
    that's the way I do it: null
    that's the way they, they might seem outwardly,: null
    that's us too: null
    that's us too.: null
    that's what I find lacking in a lot of, like HOME ALONE.: null
    that's what I was ,: null
    that's what I was thinking.: null
    that's what he would have liked to have seen REGARDING HENRY, too,: null
    that's what my wife does too,: null
    that's when the movie was filmed,: null
    that's who the guy is.: null
    that's why I saw that one.: null
    that's why I watched another silly movie, with my cousin, was the one about the, the turtles,: null
    that's, that's a, that's a real interesting movie: null
    that, and plus, part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt.: null
    that, her sister got killed: null
    that, that just reminded me of that.: null
    that, that just reminds me of, back in school: null
    that, that was number one for the week too,: null
    that, that's, that's a real good movie to see.: null
    that, that, that's okay.: null
    the Immigration and national, Naturalization Service, started investigating.: null
    the JAGGED EDGE: null
    the JAGGED EDGE,: null
    the Lord just said no,: null
    the MALTESE FALCON and all those,: null
    ? the Master should, according to the classic myth, the sort of Joseph Campbell
      type myth, he, the Master should have died at the end
    : null
    the RAIN MAN was one.: null
    the ROBIN HOOD coming out: null
    the accents up there fascinated me, because even in his family alone, there were several different accents: null
    the acting was bland.: null
    the aftermath is usually not there.: null
    the book, to me, was far more frightening than the movie was.: null
    the bourgeoisie was, was, was definitely out of, style, then.: null
    the boy actually rides on his back: null
    the cat gets, on this treacherous journey.: null
    the character that, James Earle Jones played?: null
    the closest movie theater was Barry Saint Edmunds: null
    the defense's job is to make sure that you, you do,: null
    the drugs didn't work for long,: null
    the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie was, I was very well persuaded to walk out. Very well persuaded,: null
    the first person I've talked to outside of Texas.: null
    the first week, I think, a lot more people were doing it.: null
    the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something.: null
    the good guys can get hit all day long: null
    the guy that comes back is not her original husband,: null
    ? the guy, the guy that played in it, the one that played in it that I liked best
      was the one who was in, the one about the old people.
    : null
    ? the idea of getting a little extra with it I think is a good idea. Because they,
      they make bundles of money off those things.
    : null
    the interesting thing was is I had heard that,: null
    the language in it is just for no reason, has to stick in,: null
    ? the last movie I saw I guess, was, the one about the French, the Frenchman that
      leaves and comes back, and he's someone different.
    : null
    the last movie I saw was REGARDIN, REGARDING HENRY.: null
    the last movie I saw was THE HARD WAY with Michael J. Fox.: null
    the last movie I saw was the FIVE HEARTBEATS: null
    the last movie I saw was, SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY.: null
    the last movie I saw, but it wasn't my choice, was the NINJA TURTLE movie .: null
    the last movie that I have seen,: null
    the last movie that I saw,: null
    the last movies that I've seen were probably on video.: null
    the last one we saw was THELMA AND LOUISE.: null
    the last two I saw him in, one of those BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART THREE deals: null
    the lines in there were just perfect.: null
    the little boy must have been, maybe about ten.: null
    the matinee starts before I can get away from work.: null
    the more you got to thinking about it, the more you thought, I did like it .: null
    the most recent movie I saw, I'm afraid was,: null
    the most recent ones that I've seen are those two, GHOST and, DANCES WITH WOLVES,: null
    the movie had the whole, lot of philosophical content, more than, more than,: null
    the new one that came out.: null
    the new one, of course .: null
    the older generation is not needed: null
    the only reason I know why it ended is on ARSENIO HALL one night, Christopher Reeves told,: null
    ? the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it didn't, that,
      that, the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things.
    : null
    the other day I got one about fishing: null
    the other one was, vegetarian kind of, feel good tribe.: null
    the other one, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, is kind of a, a gory movie, if, if somebody's not into that kind of stuff.: null
    the plot was bland,: null
    the premise of the story is that, you go to a pla, after you die you go to a place called Judgment City.: null
    the previews looked so good that I wanted to see it: null
    the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level,: null
    the regular NAKED GUN and AIRPORT and,: null
    the second one ,: null
    ? the second week I was out of the hospital I went up and worked half day on the
      computers cause you can learn all the software for free.
    : null
    the story was,: null
    the supporting actor, he was good,: null
    the thing that I didn't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row, time wise they happen one after another: null
    the titles might sound familiar: null
    the wagon, the wagon driver.: null
    the warmth that developed between them: null
    the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic,: null
    the whole premise is that they go out: null
    the whole theater was hysterical: null
    the whole thing was about the size of a, a medium house .: null
    the whole way .: null
    the youngest is three.: null
    the, that's the one I wanted to see where he was on, she was on a carnival, at a carnival on a Ferris wheel or something.: null
    the, the Chin, the commu, the communist Chinese didn't like this at all.: null
    the, the character was, prior to that had, had been someone that had killed other people: null

    to think about how it just changed the whole landscape, you could follow this, this beaten down path,: null

    we, we, rented the other one,: null
    we, we, we t, we, we're, we're big movie people: null
    we, when, when the movie came out, we went,: null
    what I try to do when they come out is just make a list of them that look good: null
    what is coincidence,: null
    when I go, I go see two at a time.: null
    when I thought of that, I thought of,: null
    when I was in England years ago.: null
    when I, each time that I thought that the Indians were going to get killed, I cried.: null
    when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him.: null

    when the, when the anniversary came up: null
    when they were trying to film that, the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young's buffalo.: null
    whenever she starts crying .: null
    ? whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen fortynine occurred and most churches
      were either banned or their, all the clergy and so forth were killed or, or
      imprisoned or, and the property confiscated, she was safe because she had, not
      officially joined the, the Christian movement.
    : null
    where I lived. it was a little town called Newmarket.: null
    which was a,: null
    who was the,: null
    why didn't she just tell hi,: null
    why didn't she just tell him to straighten up.: null
    you actually have to go up there: null
    you always, end up with expectations too high or whatever,: null
    you can get around .: null
    you can hear all the barking,: null
    you can imagine what Plano was like eighteen years ago.: null
    you could tell it,: null
    you could tell when it was coming.: null
    you get these twists: null
    you get, matinee prices.: null
    you have a, they have an attorney for, attorney for you and attorney,: null
    you just kind of went with it.: null
    you just really can't watch a lot of that.: null
    you knew what was going to happen, of course.: null
    you knew, you knew when the murder was going to happen or something,: null
    you know PRETTY WOMAN was kind of a light comedy and a romance,: null
    you know all the story and who did what: null
    you see him coming out of the clouds, his head coming out and then the bird coming out,: null
    you see people who are severely injured, very, very badly, lose control of body functions: null
    you sound very young: null
    you think back,: null
    you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating.: null
    you're catching me at, it, at mind's end here.: null
    you're not sure whether it will be any good or not: null
    you've probably seen him: null
    you, you go watch the movie.: null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    A lot of those are really violent type movies.: null
    Again the relationship, between the two, that, never would have occurred, by accident.: null
    All I know about that woman is that she's an in, incredible .: null
    All the way through history, there's, I guess,: null
    All those old good ones that you, wish they had on: null
    Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be, a bit of a variety actor,: null
    At first he was just a big muscle man.: null
    At first, it was kind of strange,: null
    Both of them were great.: null
    Cause when you're touristing, you probably don't want to take the time to go see a movie.: null
    Chuck Norris, of course, could be just about equal,: null
    Course, it's so expensive, now, too: null
    DANCES WITH WOLVES did not seem to have anything added.: null
    DINER is really worth seeing.: null
    Definitely.: null
    Even when he's sad, you great faith that he will get happy again.: null
    Eventually I'm sure they will come out with the,: null
    Every, everybody makes the obligatory trip to Stonehenge.: null
    FIELD OF DREAMS was good,: null
    FIVE was, the script was bad, bad, bad .: null
    Gene Hackman's a good actor.: null
    Gosh, was that wonderful.: null
    He did great.: null
    He is one of the best actors I've ever seen.: null
    He seems so macho I just .: null
    He wanted to direct it,: null
    He's a good actor though.: null
    He's a very good writer: null
    Hollywood, they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there, I think.: null
    However, the rumor is, is that it will happen next, happen next time: null
    I can't remember the titles any more. some really weird ones, with quite a random crew of, of characters.: null
    I didn't see that, because I didn't think I would care for it.: null
    I didn't think it was as good as all the, hype was about it.: null
    I didn't think that one was near as good.: null
    I didn't think they were great for my daughter .: null
    I do not think they were very good during that time.: null
    I don't either .: null
    I don't see why they have to do that,: null
    I don't think anybody, anything could ever beat that.: null
    I don't think he's really a very good actor.: null
    I don't think it was as funny as what I was an, anticipating,: null
    I don't think the general audience would, would go for it.: null
    I don't think too many of them are anymore.: null
    I got a little sick of his mug on the screen every,: null
    I guess I can't go see it ,: null
    I guess I will have to see it then.: null
    I guess because he is good looking.: null
    I guess because we don't know,: null
    I guess it was okay,: null
    I guess it, it really isn't for everybody.: null
    I guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater: null
    I guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is,: null
    I guess that I thought was a real good acting and writing job both, because I think, or directing job.: null
    I guess that's why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars,: null
    I guess they figured we wouldn't, can't tell the difference between an,: null
    I guess they would like Jerry Lewis, too.: null
    I guess they're just not domesticated,: null
    I guess they, they'll probably come out with a lot of movies,: null
    I guess you could do that, get all of David Carradine's movies,: null
    I hope he stays cute: null
    I just didn't find that one to be real,: null
    I just have a problem paying twenty five dollars for a movie that I can go down and rent for a dollar .: null
    I just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro.: null
    I just think he's pretty good.: null
    I just thought that was terrific.: null
    I just thought the act, the, author could have been patterned after that,: null
    I know that sounds awful because so many people think he's so wonderful: null
    I know that sounds funny coming from a woman,: null
    I know, it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive.: null
    I mean it was a real consciousness raiser, I guess.: null
    I need to go see it.: null
    ? I only bring up because that was what ten years ago you read and, and understood,
      about the American pop, Indian population,
    : null
    I realize that. to go to these movies and expect them to be, other than just, just good entertainment: null
    ? I really believe Schwarzenegger is really going to be a varie, variety player
      more so than he is, because he really played the part good.
    : null
    I should think we've done enough.: null
    I suspect it's always been a preoccupation with that sort of things.: null
    I suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it.: null
    I think I heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something,: null
    I think SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT was a little bit like that.: null
    I think a lot of kids, get the same kind of fears, like there's somebody under the bed.: null
    I think about, just the meaning of, the freedom of this country and, and what that really meant.: null
    I think he just really w, he really wanted it.: null
    I think he made the movie,: null
    I think he ought to stay Indiana Jones.: null
    I think he's really good.: null
    I think he, he needs a comedy, too.: null
    I think in this one it wasn't so good.: null
    I think it is.: null
    I think it was something that he really wanted to do.: null
    I think it was the black hills of South Dakota.: null
    I think it's an excellent movie for,: null
    I think it's just playing now up here.: null
    I think it's just,: null
    I think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie.: null
    I think it, it's just losing its originality or something.: null
    I think just most people have V C R s now: null
    I think movies are losing their attractiveness, just to a lot of people.: null
    I think one is enough.: null
    I think that GHOSTS was one of those that a lot of people didn't think was going to be any good.: null
    I think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning, whether he is or not.: null
    I think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight.: null
    I think that is, that is the point.: null
    I think that's important if you're going, if you're going, kids are going to, parents are going to have to go: null
    I think that's supposed to be good,: null
    I think that's why a lot of people go to see him, though .: null
    I think that, I think he did a good job: null
    I think the script was, just incredible compared to the last one.: null
    I think they did a real good job of that.: null
    I think they're both excellent movies.: null
    I think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo.: null
    I think we're going to have a white Christmas up here just like the song says.: null
    I think we're, we're, we've done okay, though.: null
    I think we've made it.: null
    I think we've probably,: null
    I think you would really like PRETTY WOMAN,: null
    I think, I think SIXTEEN CANDLES was the name of it.: null
    I think, I think it was very one sided.: null
    I think, I think though, that movies are losing their luster.: null
    I though that was a really cute movie,: null
    I thought Kevin Costner was just,: null
    I thought PRETTY WOMAN was a really good movie, too.: null
    I thought he looked real good with a beard, too.: null
    ? I thought it had a wonderful message to it. It's the kind you came out and looked
      at somebody and said, I think I liked that .
    : null
    I thought it was a very interesting movie.: null
    I thought it was an okay movie,: null
    I thought it was awful,: null
    I thought it was funny.: null
    I thought it was just of like you didn't know this was going to happen,: null
    I thought it was very well done.: null
    I thought she,: null
    I thought that might be kind of fun to do.: null
    I thought that was a very good movie.: null
    I thought that was appropriate just for everyone.: null
    I thought that was pushing it a little bit: null
    I thought that was really good.: null
    I thought that's, that's close enough to being several,: null
    ? I thought the funny part in HOME ALONE was, that's good for kids, is kind of
      coming up with how they can deal with problems on their own without panicking
    : null
    I thought the scenes when the buffalos running, though, were beautiful,: null
    I thought the story was pretty good, too.: null
    I thought they could learn a lot of lessons from that.: null
    I thought, it's good that,: null
    I was just going to say, th, you should see those, fi, first if you can.: null
    I was, it was great.: null
    I'd be just fine without them, because, kids come running out wanting to beat each other up.: null
    I'm just, I guess I'm just middle America or something.: null
    I'm not really into those.: null
    I'm not sure I would have enjoyed that at all.: null
    I'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them.: null
    I, I couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for, best picture.: null
    I, I don't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was.: null
    I, I don't, I guess I thought it was too far fetched: null
    I, I imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the F B I, going, I guess.: null
    I, I imagine the way SOAPDISH was, but, with: null
    I, I just thought it was a really interesting, intense film.: null
    I, I just thought it was too far fetched.: null
    I, I just thought life would be,: null
    I, I think Kevin Costner did a really good job with it.: null
    I, I think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of, of how to act from Dustin Hoffman,: null
    I, I was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was.: null
    I, I, it's a little far fetched to,: null
    ? I, the, the, I think the, the best thing about RAINMAN was the, the way that
      they put together the, the real awfulness of the, of the, of the disease,
    : null
    If y, if you read the book it's, even better.: null
    If you hear that music, everybody knows what you are talking about.: null
    Intense I think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast.: null
    It didn't, it didn't have any real social bearing: null
    It is an incredible book.: null
    It just was not enough to it.: null
    It really and truly does, because to get the feeling: null
    It seemed re, it seemed real,: null
    It still just seems a little twisted to me .: null
    It was a beautiful story,: null
    It was done real well too.: null
    It was good.: null
    It was just a happy movie.: null
    It was just all legitimate kind of, film.: null
    It was just crazy enough for th,: null
    It was not bad: null
    It was okay.: null
    It was real different then you'd expect,: null
    It was really cute.: null
    It was really good.: null
    It was really, the Hollywood really must think there's some real dummies out there or something.: null
    It was so funny and it sounds like, what you were just describing, SOAPDISH, too.: null
    It was so funny.: null
    It was such a,: null
    It was true, it was truly awful.: null
    It was very good.: null
    It was, it was kind of like the STAR WARS: null
    It was, it was scary.: null
    It was, it was such a rout though,: null
    It's a kind of one of those psycho ones.: null
    It's a really good show.: null
    It's about time for one of those.: null
    It's almost more fun: null
    It's amazing .: null
    It's boring.: null
    It's funny how your little minds work,: null
    It's funny.: null
    It's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore.: null
    It's hard to know what the good movies are anymore.: null
    It's kind of like waterfront property or something: null
    It's like ROCKY films.: null
    It's pretty good.: null
    It's pretty, it's pretty cute.: null
    It's really good.: null
    It's sort of a modern CINDERELLA type of story.: null
    It's, it's a shame,: null
    It's, it's so well written.: null
    It, it might have one best picture, too.: null
    It, it really just turned out nicely.: null
    It, it was,: null
    It, really is very, very interesting.: null
    James Woods, I think is who it was, did an excellent job as the cop.: null
    Jean Luke does more of a, a,: null
    Jody Foster was good, too, but I think, I think Anthony Perkins was the one that, that really made the movie,: null
    Julia Roberts is good.: null
    Just more of the same.: null
    Just, they just carried it off,: null
    L, Leonard, s, Nimoy, he does a lot better.: null
    Life's depressing enough .: null
    Maybe i, maybe that was,: null
    Might have been Michael Douglas. that starred in it. *listen: null
    Most of them are a coin flip .: null
    Must have left an impression.: null
    Nobody can get along peacefully .: null
    Not anymore.: null
    Not, not too often .: null
    Of course, no one will ever know.: null
    Probably gives them ideas of what they want to do,: null
    Probably know him if I saw him.: null
    Probably one of the best things about it was the scenery: null
    Probably some of them did .: null
    Probably, probably worth seeing on video.: null
    Real scruffy looking,: null
    Really gory.: null
    She knows how to do that.: null
    She's rich .: null
    Shoeless Joe Jackson really was a player.: null
    Some of it just isn't,: null
    Some of them are pretty bad.: null
    Sometimes I think we think it is.: null
    Sometimes you're in the mood for it even.: null
    Sort of interesting,: null
    Sounds a lot a like a Walt Disney film.: null
    TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES was sort of the same way,: null
    TWINS was good too,: null
    TWO THOUSAND AND ONE was a good movie if you had read the book.: null
    TWO THOUSAND AND TEN was far better.: null
    Th, that sounds a lot like a Walt Disney film.: null
    That always seems to happen when you rent them, .: null
    That has gotten to be a whole camp i, idea now though,: null
    That is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people.: null
    That makes a lot of sense .: null
    That needs the big screen.: null
    That one looks so scary just,: null
    That sounds like an interesting concept.: null
    That wa, that was pretty good.: null
    That was a good one.: null
    That was a mistake that they made.: null
    That was a really good movie.: null
    That was excellent.: null
    That was good,: null
    That was good.: null
    That was hilarious.: null
    That was neat.: null
    That was rather, gross .: null
    That was very good.: null
    That was, that was a good movie.: null
    That was, that was pretty good.: null
    That was, that was pretty interesting movie,: null
    That was, that was so funny,: null
    That would be pretty good.: null
    That's a real good show.: null
    That's a real warm movie.: null
    That's an excellent movie.: null
    That's at, that one won't your sides .: null
    That's good.: null
    That's not an easy part to play, I, I don't think .: null
    That's the magic of Hollywood, special effects.: null
    That's true.: null
    That's what they when the thing hasn't won any award. *listen: null
    That, that can make you crabby, yes.: null
    That, that makes it worth it,: null
    That, that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable that's still worth watching.: null
    That, that was cute.: null
    That, that's horrible,: null
    The acting was phenomenal.: null
    The book was excellent.: null
    The characters played very well off one another.: null
    The cinematography is just beautiful really beautiful scenes and real good music.: null
    The most recent one that, my wife and I have seen was the CITY SLICKER.: null
    The thing that I thought was interesting was that the critics,: null
    There are a number of good movies like that.: null
    There was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying: null
    There's a certain a mount of dribble that they do.: null
    There's nothing wrong with that.: null
    There's only one way of finding it.: null
    There's some nice stuff over there to see.: null
    They hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody.: null
    They just changed it because X had a connotation with it,: null
    They say is really frightening, too.: null
    They say it's really horrifyingly scary: null
    They shouldn't have done it.: null
    They're more interesting.: null
    They're, they're just strange.: null
    Unbelievable.: null
    Usually if a movie is good, once is enough .: null
    Vulcans age a lot better .: null
    Walt Disney's kind of gotten worse in my opinion over the past few years.: null
    Water view .: null
    Waterfront property here at Love Canal,: null
    We just keep breeding them.: null
    We like those things that way.: null
    When the shoe is on the other foot and see how it,: null
    When they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can.: null
    When you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies,: null
    Which most of them probably aren't .: null
    Y, you have to go see that one.: null
    You can do that, but it is difficult if you, if you work or,: null
    You can tell I'm an animal lover,: null
    You can't just watch them by yourself or else,: null
    You can't put it in pictures.: null
    You don't even, you don't even realize it,: null
    You expect more out of, Julia Roberts, though.: null
    You give it subtitles, they won't watch,: null
    You had to wade through it and find it .: null
    You just had to find it.: null
    You know how they can make any of, any single one of them in a movie to be a: null
    You must really keep up.: null
    You never quite got to,: null
    You really truly do.: null
    You see it on video just as soon as it is on the movie screen.: null
    You weren't sure exactly how it would get there,: null
    You'll have nightmares,: null
    You're right,: null
    a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film, you co, say what is this?: null
    a lot of the Disney movies, it's just too expensive,: null
    a lot of times it is added for no real, valid reason.: null
    again it, I think was a picture of relationships.: null
    all of them, I guess, could be in that fashion,: null
    all the comedies are more like jokes and, gags and stuff like that: null
    all you can do is put it in words.: null
    and they're making the movie according to certain formula that's a good formula: null
    and yet it was his character that was so intriguing,: null
    and, but, but, a little bit strange and esoteric: null
    apparently it's going to win everything.: null
    as far as I was concerned, TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES could have been a classic of world theater: null
    as long as we keep paying the money for it, they are going to keep paying them.: null
    basic thick western U S accent for a ROBIN HOOD just doesn't seem to fit.: null
    boy there's a lots going on in there .: null
    but much more true to life: null
    by the time you get a babysitter, and then pay to go to the movies: null
    cause it's, it's just a fun summer light comedy,: null
    course, growing up on, on the back of a horse, and being on ranches and stuff, so much of that was so true: null
    critically acclaimed.: null
    didn't need to.: null
    even on those type they don't show what you expect.: null
    even the movies that want to show violence as real, they don't really show you what happens with that real violence: null
    every now and then you find one that you say, yeah,: null
    everything went away for a couple years,: null
    except that the rumor is, is that they still might,: null
    for some people, that's just, that's out of the question,: null
    from Love Canal .: null
    from a woman's point of view and it was very, chauvinistic as far as women go.: null
    ? given the size of the house and how clever the kid was, it seems to me they
      could have done a lot more, basically stepping on things and yelling in pain
    : null
    he certainly could have been.: null
    he could be this rough, tough guy and then, this substitute teacher.: null
    he did some clever things,: null
    he had a way of putting you in that scene,: null
    he has done a really good job of characterizing the, disabled person.: null
    he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older.: null
    he wanted to, to star in it.: null
    he was always slick, and greasy, and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed: null
    he's kind of branching out.: null
    he's very good in REGARDING HENRY.: null
    he's very good.: null
    he's, he's talented,: null
    he, he enjoyed the story line: null
    he, he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time.: null
    he, he, he did pretty good on that one.: null
    his heart was in it,: null
    hysterical.: null
    i, it could easily have been patterned after him.: null
    if something gets really good reviews, maybe you'd finally go spend the twelve bucks,: null
    if you didn't like BEETLEJUICE you'll probably won't like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS.: null
    ? if you don't, with some of the movies, if you don't go to them within the first
      four weeks, the movie may have, left town, never to show up again until it comes
      back in video.
    : null
    if you want to call its mysticism or the occult or whatever. It's always fascinated.: null
    if you weren't, if you weren't drawn to watch that, you, maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies, either.: null
    if you, if you liked BEETLEJUICE you'll probably like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS,: null
    if, if she enjoys movies I think it'll work pretty good.: null
    in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend, you've got to rent it on Thursday.: null
    it always balances out one way or the other: null
    it certainly would, would explain the preoccupation with ,: null
    it could have been,: null
    it doesn't seem like it's as big, rage to get the movie theater as it used to be.: null
    it is so overacted that you're just hysterical: null
    it is, it is,: null
    it is, to me an outstanding movie.: null
    it kind of makes you wonder,: null
    it kind of runs in, in batches,: null
    it made you feel really good.: null
    it made you think a lot: null
    it may not include the entire crew: null
    ? it must have been great just being with him on, on a daily basis and seeing
      how he prepares for his, for his lines and all that stuff.
    : null
    it really was good even though it is such a long movie.: null
    it really was.: null
    it says a lot about middle life: null
    it says a lot about,: null
    it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used.: null
    it should be out on T V, I would think,: null
    it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing.: null
    it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs.: null
    it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies.: null
    it turned out to be an excellent movie.: null
    it wa, it was really funny, it's, that, that he winds up playing in the movie.: null
    it was a good movie.: null
    it was a lot of fun.: null
    it was a pretty good movie.: null
    it was a very famous, popular movie.: null
    it was a very good movie.: null
    it was a, of course, one of the typical: null
    it was all right,: null
    it was better than it could have been.: null
    it was excellent,: null
    it was good,: null
    it was great .: null
    it was great.: null
    it was just a rumor that that would happen this time.: null
    it was just how she got so caught up,: null
    it was just hysterical.: null
    it was just kind of a get away movie.: null
    it was just, it was done so well,: null
    it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie. And children, young children could see, could have seen that movie,: null
    it was okay.: null
    it was really good.: null
    it was shocking at the end too.: null
    it was silly.: null
    it was so good.: null
    it was violent.: null
    it was well done but, that is one reason why it was scary.: null
    it was, it was a classic Greek, a sort of, European mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with: null
    it was, it was a great movie though.: null
    it was, it was an amusing movie.: null
    it was, it was innovative, a completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways,: null
    it was, it was more of a love story: null
    it was, it was not a bad movie.: null
    it was, it was really good .: null
    it wasn't impressive necessarily,: null
    it wasn't worth anything.: null
    it will be a next generation meets this generation .: null
    it would have made, these Fellini movies look normal.: null
    it would have make it, broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for, I thought: null
    it would, it would be to anyone because, they really don't know that much about it.: null
    it wouldn't have hurt the movie to do that,: null
    it'll teach a great lesson, because she ended: null
    it's a little disturbing the violence in these films,: null
    it's a matter of your taste,: null
    it's a really good show.: null
    ? it's a side that hasn't been told. as far as, telling it from, the Indians as
      the good guys and the, the white men as the bad guys.
    : null
    it's almost more fun really to rent movies. just kind of stay at home, maybe.: null
    it's amazing,: null
    it's as simple as that.: null
    it's beautifully done.: null
    it's definitely a lot better . A lot more realistic really.: null
    it's funny because most women aren't really,: null
    it's great.: null
    it's hard to believe that, this really happened.: null
    it's hard, it's hard to find a movie any more these days that you can take your kids: null
    it's it was, it was a fun movie.: null
    it's just a very, very bad thing,: null
    it's just as suspenseful, I think.: null
    it's just it's something that anyone can watch and enjoy.: null
    it's just so well done.: null
    it's just, it's just goofy.: null
    it's kind of both, I guess,: null
    it's like golly,: null
    it's lot better.: null
    it's not too bad.: null
    it's not, it's not as bad as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.: null
    it's sort of a popular view of, what happened way back then.: null
    it's terrible.: null
    it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie.: null
    it's worth doing it.: null
    it's, if you keep up with movies, it's kind of interesting.: null
    it's, it seems like, that kind of: null
    it's, it's a little different, because you see things from a different: null
    it's, it's a really good movie,: null
    it's, it's fun to,: null
    it's, it's interesting.: null
    it's, it's really stirring.: null
    it's, it's something that,: null
    it's, it's, it's a glorious movie: null
    it's, one of those movies that it's not a great movie: null
    it, it has surprised everybody.: null
    it, it looks good,: null
    it, it meant something bigger I think.: null
    it, it really was a fantastic movie.: null
    it, it was a strange combination.: null
    it, it's interesting, though,: null
    it, it's just the idea that these, these actors, live in such lavish style.: null
    just a touch.: null
    just generally, that kind of scary stuff I, I just don't want to have anything to do with it.: null
    just you see the same story lines, different characters: null
    life is a little slower, a little easier.: null
    like I said, with CITY SLICK, with SOAPDISH, it is so cornball: null
    make your cheeks hurt laughing.: null
    nobody could figure it out.: null
    normally never the twain shall meet.: null
    now it's back again.: null
    of course, Robin Williams always just has a, an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing.: null
    of course, he's such a, very good actor anyway: null
    of course, you need a babysitter for that .: null
    of the three of those, DINER's probably the best.: null
    on the, on the broad scope if, it, it, it had a much bigger thing I thin,: null
    other than that it just seems like it's so expensive.: null
    people like us, .: null
    real scruffy looking .: null
    really good ending: null
    really, really good.: null
    really, when you stop and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie: null
    seems like the rating system, is kind of switching that way a little bit .: null
    she's smart at what she does.: null
    so many of them are done so poorly,: null
    so many of them are just done real,: null
    so many people said no it wasn't,: null
    some of them are done good: null
    some of them, they, they'll start in one area of the country,: null
    sometimes the reviews you just can't go by.: null
    still it was a fantas,: null
    students might try to do it.: null
    th, that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him, certainly.: null
    tha, that's true,: null
    that does sound fun.: null
    that is a really good movie, if you like special effects,: null
    that is horrible: null
    that is kind of steep,: null
    that is taking the middle of the afternoon.: null
    that is where reason why I suppose it won so many Oscars,: null
    that looks good.: null
    that looks really good too.: null
    that may be,: null
    that mov, that was one movie I came out impressed.: null
    that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats,: null
    that one was just a very poignant story,: null
    that one was.: null
    that one wasn't that great either.: null
    that really wasn't too bad.: null
    that seems to be the norm of most movies,: null
    that that's really like an all time classic.: null
    that was crummy also.: null
    that was good,: null
    that was good.: null
    that was great one.: null
    that was great.: null
    that was just excessively violent.: null
    that was just so good.: null
    that was okay,: null
    that was pretty good, though,: null
    that was pretty good.: null
    that was pretty.: null
    that was really intriguing,: null
    that was so good.: null
    that was taking over somebody else's freedoms.: null
    that was very good.: null
    that was, that was an excellent movie.: null
    that was, that was pretty funny,: null
    that was, was really good.: null
    that wasn't too bad on tearjerker: null
    that wouldn't problem.: null
    that's a wonderful, wonderful job by Robin Williams and Peter De Niro.: null
    that's kind of a: null
    that's kind of what, in a way, how it kind of bothered you, the way it ended and stuff.: null
    that's that bad then.: null
    that's what they're for,: null
    that's what you're, you're, dealing with.: null
    that's, that was a really good movie.: null
    that, it just doesn't even give you the effect,: null
    that, it's good because it does make you think, about your own family.: null
    that, that is what makes it so interesting.: null
    that, that was just, had all kinds of things throughout the whole movie,: null
    that, that was so wonderful that they done that: null
    that, that's true.: null
    the book is really good.: null
    the buffalo scene in that thing: null
    the costuming *slash error: null
    the idea that they may put a little extra in it I think is a good idea.: null
    the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it.: null
    ? the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just
      a little bit of sex and violence in order to get a, a tougher rating. Which
      suggests that, that, it will be more enticing to the, to the public.
    : null
    the popcorn and everything else,: null
    the price is as reasonable as renting a video.: null
    the problem is you always have to wait until they're out.: null
    the second time you see it, you understand more subtleties in it.: null
    the selfsatisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him.: null
    the story was a very dramatic story,: null
    the whole idea behind it is far fetched.: null
    the whole movie is kind of far fetched.: null
    their, their, the language on that's filthy.: null
    ? then there's these, periods like early fall before Christmas or early spring
      when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again,
      it, will increase the revenues from the movie.
    : null
    there are certain things you can't do with a video: null
    there are certain, qualities that suggest it could be he.: null
    there are no answers,: null
    there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world.: null
    there was a lot of human character there,: null
    there was a lot of pretty scenery, too, in that movie.: null
    there was, it was like, STEEL MAGNOLIAS.: null
    there wasn't any part of it that you really felt like, no, this can't happen.: null
    there's always something that,: null
    there's no real way of finding out.: null
    there's no way to protect them any more.: null
    there's not as much slapstick anymore.: null
    there's not too many that are, that are good just on their, that, that you wouldn't want to change something,: null
    there's something about it that just, it isn't just slapstick,: null
    there's something about it that's so innovative,: null
    there's something about the human character in it: null
    there's, there's been a, a fair number of, of pretty good movies out recently.: null
    they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it,: null
    they could try to make,: null
    they did a real good job with it.: null
    they didn't, they didn't age it: null
    they do scare you.: null
    they don't last that long.: null
    they don't, they, they could make them better,: null
    they grow up too fast,: null
    they just don't howl that much anymore.: null
    they keep it rather secretive,: null
    ? they made a big deal about how this, this film was such a big leap for the,
      the people who, who were the ancestors of the, this Indian tribe
    : null
    they never present that,: null
    they seem to fall short of, of being really creative with a lot of things,: null
    they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more: null
    they sort of candy coated the western story for many years,: null
    they tried to keep it, as very close to real.: null
    they were done a little more tastefully.: null
    they won't come within ten feet of,: null
    they're just really good movies.: null
    they're kind of fun to watch in a way.: null
    they're some of the best of, that are made.: null
    they're usually not, not that great or didn't do that great anyway.: null
    they're, they're all pretty good,: null
    they've probably seen about everything at this point .: null
    they, I guess they figured, they know what they're doing,: null
    they, they, they have all these neat phrases.: null
    this is kind of neat.: null
    this, French I guess are into the slapsti,: null
    those are two definite must see movies, I think.: null
    those old movies seemed to have had something: null
    to me it's somewhat like PRETTY WOMAN.: null
    unless a movie is popular and stays around, you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie.: null
    was that good.: null
    we're at about five minutes.: null
    we've, we've got a lot of company this summer, which is wonderful.: null
    when I compare the winners of this year and last year, it just,: null
    when it was, the real slapstick moments, him versus the criminals kind of thing, it just sort of lost the human element: null
    when the truth,: null
    when they listened to that tape they would have really had a good time,: null
    when you first came out, you weren't real sure.: null
    ? whether it, whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at
      the box office, I think he would have been happy.
    : null
    which does not make,: null
    with luck, you'll have one or two that are good.: null
    ? yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable, because the, the
      story was stupid, and, and then things like that,

    you almost can't afford to do it.: null
    you are right,: null
    you can hear my dog .: null
    you can watch the characters develop,: null
    you could rent it: null
    you didn't,: null
    you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things,: null
    you get to where: null
    you have to like,: null
    you have to see those twice to catch everything.: null
    you have, you have to just sort of like this thing,: null
    you just gave it away,: null
    you kind of have to like to be, drawn to this point where you aren't sure what's going to happen.: null
    you kind of wait: null
    you knew where it would end up.: null
    you might not be so: null
    you need to, to work with it, certainly on, on a daily basis but then ag, then again work with it toward a good end.: null
    you never know.: null
    you think, for a Stephen, it because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory: null
    you would applaud Bruce Willis in DIE HARD if he was doing this: null
    you wouldn't like to see anybo, anything happen to anybody,: null
    you're glad you ain't got a four year old.: null
    you're not a thirteen year old.: null
    you're thinking of Rick Moranis.: null

    Big long strips.: null
    Every time the sun would come up in the morning I'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can.: null

    For some reason, they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway: null
    He came and did it that way: null

    I haven't figured out how you're supposed to paint it, on down, so that you won't see where you stopped off: null
    I haven't tried a, a spray varnish.: null
    I haven't used it yet.: null
    I heard about that.: null
    I helped someone repaint an apartment,: null
    I hired this man to come in and do it. A young kid.: null
    I hope your project turns out great: null
    I just bought a spray gun, one of those airless, not airless, high volume, low pressure spray guns.: null
    ? I just called him because I got a little ad out of the, the or whatever in the
      mail, and, just got this painter person over here.
    : null
    I just don't think, that there was that big problem .: null

    ? I read an article recently that, you have to be very careful on the kind of
      paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend to, to peel
      or come off because of the moisture, high moisture content in your bath, bathroom.
    : null
    I really enjoy doing that.: null
    I really love the tole painting.: null
    I repainted the whole thing.: null
    I said, Okay, it's your place,: null
    I saw one that was kind on an ecru undercoat: null
    I still feel good, the minute I put that paint on, even if it does got a dent in it: null
    I sure did my share of just regular painting.: null
    I think I am going to do it this spring actually.: null
    I think I could probably do it: null
    I think I will probably just do it, in a roller.: null
    I think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up.: null
    I think it's because they, they were accustomed to working in that environment, in those particular condominiums,: null
    I think my husband's really glad about that .: null
    I think that is what we might have to do with this chimney,: null
    I think though, we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work, because I don't know if I could,: null
    I think we are going to do, another bathroom,: null
    I think, I think we left most of it because it gets to be,: null
    I tried to cover it with white,: null
    I tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago, with a just a scraper and wet sponge: null
    I use just a wood sealer.: null
    I want something that's going to tie that together: null
    I want to do it about the same color. And just be a little,: null
    I was do, just doing just the trim outs that, around the doors and windows: null
    I was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that I've done.: null
    I was out there last week: null
    I was pretty tied up,: null
    I was talking to somebody else who, who had a lot of wood panelling: null
    I went around the trim,: null
    I went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys,: null
    I went to wash the brushes out, and, wash my hands,: null
    I will tell you that I have retired from the painting business.: null
    I would like to learn that someday,: null
    I would, I really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to.: null
    I'd have probably rolled it on.: null
    I'd hire a professional.: null
    I'd, it would have taken me forever.: null
    I'll find, I'll find something as I'm going along, something not related,: null
    I'll just do a little bit here and .: null
    I'm a selfproclaimed, proclaimed perfectionist,: null
    I'm always doing all this other stuff,: null
    I'm changing the, the towel racks and stuff, the, the fixtures out to make them wood,: null
    I'm glad it's done, because it's brighter.: null
    I'm going to put wood in there.: null
    I'm hoping that, it won't be too much of a, a problem.: null
    I'm in Garland.: null
    I'm in the middle of, going out for bids to have my house painted.: null
    I'm looking for the easy way out.: null
    I'm not overly proud of it,: null
    I'm not really quite sure,: null
    I'm real haphazard when I do it.: null
    I'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now.: null
    I'm sitting here in my forty year old house,: null
    I'm so much worried about that as what,: null
    I'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them.: null
    ? I'm wondering if I shouldn't buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it
      all in a, in a washtub or something somewhere because I'm alwa, I'm always afraid
      that the next coat is not going to match.
    : null
    I'm, I'm kind of learning at this, new at this,: null
    I'm, I'm planning on taking it off.: null
    I'm, I'm real nervous every time I, I open a new can.: null
    I'm, I'm starting to learn that there's always something else.: null
    I've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint.: null
    I've done a little,: null
    I've done, perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and, on and on, just things like that,: null
    I've got dye on my bathroom door.: null
    I've got to go to a meeting.: null
    I've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and I, as low as five hundred and forty dollars: null
    I've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth.: null
    I've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments,: null
    I've never painted anyth,: null
    I've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a surface like the house: null
    I've painted several houses, inside.: null
    I've seen that done, where there's: null
    I've used, many a gallon of them, myself.: null
    I've wanted to do that, but just haven't, just haven't mass produced enough to do that.: null
    I've, I, I grew up on a farm,: null
    I, I couldn't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder.: null
    I, I didn't like that very well,: null
    I, I don't think I could stay sane,: null
    I, I just have a scroll saw and a jig saw: null
    I, I just painted.: null
    I, I moved that,: null
    I, I took one class about, I guess three or four years ago: null
    ? I, I've also been thinking about, after looking at all these magazines, these
      design magazines and stuff, I'm thinking about maybe painting the bedroom walls
      too, in a color that will kind of, tie in our, our, our, comforter,
    : null
    I, I've, I've messed with outdoor painting a little bit,: null
    I, I, I don't want to put a price on it,: null
    I, I, I fi, find myself going to work knowing that, that there's a job about half done at home,: null
    I, it looked just like, it was the viscosity of paint thinner: null
    In a new house everything is white.: null
    In fact, I was just reading an article,: null
    In fact, we were, we were planting flowers this weekend .: null
    It covered the spots pretty good: null
    It is really scary,: null
    It seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint.: null
    It seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings: null
    It took four days.: null
    It was latex paint,: null
    It was not real pretty.: null
    It was pretty easy, actually.: null
    It was something like that, although, we sort of, when we got through I wished we hadn't done it: null
    It wasn't a big deal for them.: null
    It would be just plain paint.: null
    It wouldn't be any kind of special, special effects type thing.: null
    It's gone pretty well.: null
    It's like, they're dark.: null
    It, it looks so easy just slapping paint on.: null
    It, it sometimes works: null
    It, it was actually,: null
    It, it's hard to tell,: null
    It, it, it, comes off with a mild abrasive pad, like a scotchbrite pad or something like that and wa, and soap and water.: null
    Mike, I guess we'll be talking about painting recently.: null
    My husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers: null
    My problem is, while I,: null
    Nei, neither have I .: null
    Seems like, I've, we've done some remodeling of some, rental houses that we have: null
    Shoot, maybe a hundred and fifty.: null
    Since, it is a one story,: null
    That room I showed you.: null
    That was horrendous.: null
    That was one of the requirements from, F H A: null
    That's it .: null
    That's my worst, worst part of my woodworking.: null
    That's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the,: null
    That's what we're trying to get ours to look like.: null
    That's why I brought, bought the sprayer: null
    The brown one.: null
    The first one,: null
    The last time I had something done was my kitchen cabinets: null
    ? The only painting job that was really painless for us was in this condominium
      that the, association that manages it, they have to take care of like the structural
      damage.
    : null
    ? The only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in
      we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood, the door
      frames,
    : null
    The other, the other thing that makes it, a little more difficult, we've got all hardwood floors,: null
    There are some columns that could be painted a different color too.: null
    There are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses.: null
    They did that, maybe improvements, so they could sell it and things,: null
    They're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for Christmas,: null
    Was not, not a big deal: null
    We are just not willing to get up that high.: null
    We did it in the fall: null
    We did the outside of it one summer.: null
    We ended up with our, our living and dining room are now, kind of a, a light peach color with,: null
    We had an occasion, where we had to do some sealing: null
    We have a brick house: null
    We have a lot of light,: null
    We have one of those ladders.: null
    We have two children.: null
    We just recently, had our boys' room,: null
    We never any more.: null
    We painted every room in this house, some of them two, three times.: null
    We thought,: null
    We use, a two inch brush with, on a slant: null
    We used a flat, latex paint: null
    We were quite pleased with the result.: null
    We wound up selling the house.: null
    We're dreading it.: null
    We're, we're pretty comfortable with that.: null
    We've been trying,: null
    We, we had the same type of situation.: null
    We, we, we worked, we've worked our way back into the hallway,: null
    You can't hold it there until it's dried.: null
    You have to get the, a solution: null
    You just have to be real careful.: null
    You just, you just get in there and do it yourself.: null
    a couple of week ends: null
    a few of them were broken and things like that.: null
    a, a guest went in there: null
    actually it had been, it would have been, it had been a repaint job.: null
    actually, it took,: null
    all the trim: null
    and then above that we left it white: null
    anyway, he, when he checked out: null
    anyway. It's, it's remarkable.: null
    around the windows, if you got it on the glass, we let it dry and scraped it after that: null
    as a matter of fact this past weekend, since we had a long weekend, I, took on a painting project in my bathroom: null
    because of the b, dark behind it, it was really hard to cover: null
    by the time it's on, I, I: null
    did it myself.: null
    downstairs in the apartment, I just us, we just used a latex base,: null
    each little,: null
    either that or it had not been prepared underneath: null
    either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top: null
    else it will flake.: null
    ? ev, every time I do something, aside from that it just makes me feel a whole
      lot better to come home, an o, the walls are clean,
    : null
    even the painter couldn't give me a good estimate.: null
    every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it.: null
    everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see .: null
    fine furniture.: null
    he came with, with his own raf,: null
    he cleaned up my mess.: null
    he did part of the, in the, at night because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in,: null
    ? he didn't notice until the next morning that the shades of paint between the
      two paint cans, he had finished one can off and started another one.
    : null
    he had to paint the outside all the time.: null
    ? he had to redo them like three times before I was happy with them, before he
      was happy, that they even looked halfway decent,
    : null
    he had, he had, the, he had already carried a ladder outside: null
    he has finished everything except the chimney.: null
    he just kept painting on those French doors,: null
    he knew that .: null
    he really saved in that way.: null
    ? he said it's a good thing I went to the bathroom before dinner because if I
      had had something to drink and went in there I would think I was having hallucinations
      .
    : null
    he said, Yeah, I can finish it in a day.: null
    he said, all I got done was the taping around .: null
    he said, it's going to be just about four hours.: null
    he was gone the whole day,: null
    hire a professional,: null
    i, this was in a bathroom too.: null
    if I remember right, it was like five hundred dollars.: null
    if I would, if I'd just stay home and finish it, I'd feel a lot better,: null
    if he fell, he was dead: null
    if it was my own I would have,: null
    if you dripped it on something, as long as you wiped it up, it was real easy to clean.: null
    if you just,: null
    if you saw that the wood was getting wet, that was, that was all you needed.: null
    if you've ever painted French doors, which my husband just finally said he wasn't going to do ,: null
    in between there was a sort of a rust, put on very sparingly.: null
    in fact she put some right ba,: null
    in one bathroom it's, it's probably paper,: null
    in our down stairs in our dining room it has molding, like picture frames, I don't know what you call that: null
    in the bedroom, as I understand, that's, one of the better type of paints to have: null
    interesting.: null
    ? it appears as though that, in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses
      were built, they used a lot of, semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints
    : null
    it came right off: null
    it comes off in strips, not even little bit.: null
    it didn't, it didn't, it just didn't look as smooth as I wanted it to.: null
    it does it, electronically some, something,: null
    it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco.: null
    it had all this dark trim.: null
    it had not,: null
    ? it had vivid, almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise, and lime green and
      silver, and, a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses
      and things like that .
    : null
    it had, a little bit darker sort of peachy color,: null
    it just took him so much longer,: null
    it just, it, it gives you a, a variance even though it's the same color.: null
    it kind of bled under the masking tape which, I guess, is probably the topic we're: null
    it looked as if it had been painted,: null
    it looked pretty good, the, the interior walls all basically white,: null
    it looks at it in, and, and determines the,: null
    it makes such a difference.: null
    it makes the room look remarkably smaller.: null
    it makes the room look smaller which is,: null
    it may be the original wallpaper .: null
    it says Safe for Children, and all that.: null
    it seemed like there was, it was a good sized den with a lot panelling: null
    it sometimes doesn't.: null
    it supposedly textured it or did something to it: null
    it takes a long time,: null
    it took a lot of the hassle out.: null
    it took forever.: null
    it took me all weekend: null
    it used all of it.: null
    it was a major project getting the money together to do it too, by the end,: null
    it was absolutely hideous: null
    it was awful,: null
    it was called a sassafras,: null
    it was fairly reasonable.: null
    it was greasy or something,: null
    it was j, it was really easy,: null
    it was just the preparation time was so long.: null
    it was kind of an orangish brown.: null
    it was like paint thinner.: null
    it was like you said, it was blue: null
    it was over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff.: null
    it was part,: null
    it was quite a, a feat getting that dark a color covered, and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets,: null
    it was rented out for a couple of years and things like that.: null
    it was smooth: null
    it was very easy.: null
    it was woodwork: null
    it was, just a real dark, wood grain type paneling: null
    it's a lot like, wall paper.: null
    it's a project, that I did,: null
    it's a rent house: null
    it's been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house.: null
    it's electronic.: null
    it's going to be a big experiment.: null
    it's got all the old, original hardwood trim and stuff,: null
    it's just a hassle to go through it: null
    it's just awful.: null
    it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint,: null
    it's just terrible what they do.: null
    it's like, if you just go slow, you don't get, at least I didn't get that many mistakes: null
    it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles,: null
    it's not too bad to get it off once it's dried even.: null
    it's real cheap.: null
    it's really not to bad to get off, *typo to too: null
    it's silver, silver and yellow,: null
    it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap: null
    it's that, it's the textured wall.: null
    it's the very same type of paint and everything,: null
    it's worked out pretty well for us.: null
    it's worth the shine,: null
    it's, it's a wooden shed,: null
    it's, it's been quite an adventure.: null
    it's, it's been, it's been something else, to say the least.: null
    it's, it's not too bad.: null
    it's, it, that's half the problem right there is that it wasn't, it was a oil base,: null
    it, it looks so,: null
    it, it really was,: null
    it, it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that.: null
    it, it's just too high.: null
    it, it's really remarkable.: null
    it, it, it gets you to look at everything real hard when yo, you start putting a coat of paint on everything,: null
    it, it, it, it's just, I think it's just the, the, the dark blue to about three feet: null
    it, it, takes, it takes some time.: null
    it, turned out real, real well.: null
    know if I look underneath my cabinets, I'm not satisfied with the jobs I, I did on it because there're splotches.: null
    like I say, th, the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much.: null
    like, like, I've gone about changing out all the outlets and switches because, they, they really didn't match.: null
    literally I wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because: null
    live in Dallas.: null
    looks quite good.: null
    maybe there are some professionals out there .: null
    me, I would have had to have taped the whole thing, and then brushed around the edges,: null
    most of it, most of it's in pretty good shape.: null
    most of that, it was done with a sprayer and, up in the bucket of a loader tractor, or something like that,: null
    mostly I do like you do, give it away as gifts.: null
    mostly, just: null
    my father would be painting and I'd ask him if I could, take a turn or something,: null
    my friend said, just go ahead, you just go ahead,: null
    my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den: null
    my job was mostly the woodwork.: null
    my wife painted those, the insides of those dark blue.: null
    my wife went to the, Home Depot, I think it was, and, and took a, a copy, took a piece of brick: null
    ? my wife's hollering at me and wondering what else I've come home with from work
      this time to, to put in, a ceiling fan or something strange like that.
    : null
    now I feel like if I ever buy a house, I can probably paint, if nothing else.: null
    occasionally you can watch for it and get it on sale,: null
    of course, at night: null
    on the ceiling.: null
    one had more blue to it.: null
    one of the books that I bought, where it's d, describing the sponge painting, said you can layer different colors: null
    other than doing our own work I prefer it to a professional.: null
    other than that, it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself.: null
    our house in New Mexico, it was stucco,: null
    our house is not: null
    our two oldest boys share a room,: null
    outside you have high peeks,: null
    painted a couple of houses.: null
    painting is not hard to do,: null
    ? part of the excitement was, was getting a good deal on an older house that just,
      it really hadn't been taken care of very well.
    : null
    preparing is a real problem,: null
    pretty soon, before you know it, he's run into so many problems,: null
    primarily because it, it seems to be a little more, let's say: null
    recently this summer we painted a, out building, which is a shed that we have on the,: null
    right now my passion is tole painting .: null
    right now our house doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there,: null
    selected a, what I thought was white,: null
    she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive,: null
    she had that done.: null
    she had to start all over again: null
    she told us that the house had been, professionally painted recently.: null
    she took it: null
    she wanted to paint the shed: null
    she was selling it: null
    she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint: null
    she, she just started up a day care center,: null
    since then we have painted the bedroom.: null
    some of still has to be redone.: null
    some of the home builders are,: null
    spraying does put on a nicer finish.: null
    t's about it.: null
    table saw, scroll saw, band saw, lathe, routers,: null
    that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood: null
    that had to dry.: null
    that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes.: null
    that pretty much covers my experiences.: null
    that was a little difficult to cover with today's paints,: null
    that was not something that we had to pay for.: null
    that was the next problem.: null
    that wasn't as easy as painting the apartment .: null
    that wasn't too bad.: null
    that's an exaggeration,: null
    that's one of the reasons why we painted,: null
    that's, what we put back on there, was a latex paint.: null
    the blue, even so many years, two years later or so it doesn't match,: null
    ? the boy, one of the younger boys, when he was younger, about three years old,
      got a, got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures
      .
    : null
    the brick is multi color.: null
    the color difference wasn't so bad,: null
    the condominium we moved in before, my husband went over and painted,: null
    the daughter was a real estate agent: null
    the experience that I've had is that, whatever time he gave, said, it would take me about, just about four hours,: null
    the first time it'd probably would have taken me forever,: null
    the floors are finished with a polyurethane,: null
    the fumes are amazing,: null
    the guy called me,: null
    the guy said, get this, it's a nice shiny gloss, which was true,: null
    the house has so many windows: null
    the job was considerably tougher than we thought.: null
    the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color.: null
    the last time that, we tackled it, I did the kitchen.: null
    the lights shine right at our house.: null
    the most major things have been, I guess I, I moved a couple of outlets, and, switches I should say.: null
    the one that looks like a fudgesicle.: null
    the other project we've done around here is, we've remodeled all our, all our closets: null
    the painting actually takes probably, a fourth of the time,: null
    the painting took another day.: null
    the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath,: null
    the patterns look like they're nineteen sixties style.: null
    the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something.: null
    the people that own the house they, pay for anything like that, that we do.: null
    the problem is that it hits, the sun hits it.: null
    the problem they had: null
    the reason being is once I painted, I don't want to have to go and do it another five or seven years later: null
    the same with the toys,: null
    the second one was I bought some toys at a, at a craft fair.: null
    the spackling had to dry a day: null
    the wallpaper that I was trying to remove was black,: null
    the wallpaper, getting it off, I had to wet the walls down: null
    the walls were,: null
    the whole project basically took a week .: null
    the woodworking.: null
    ? the, one of the real strict, restrictions, was the fact that she had to have
      a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other
      good stuff
    : null
    the, the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away: null
    the, the problem that we've, we've owned this house almost five years now,: null
    the, the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white: null
    the, the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background: null
    the, the, the living room has four, good size windows: null
    then I was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff.: null
    then that way: null
    there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints,: null
    there are six houses.: null
    there isn't as much wood that has to be painted.: null
    there just isn't enough time,: null
    there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap: null
    there was a roof leak,: null
    there was no major mistakes,: null
    there was semigloss underneath: null
    there was wall paper: null
    there was wall paper,: null
    there was, I was just painting because I don't know how to do anything else .: null
    there was, they were doing all sorts of repairs,: null
    there's a whole bunch of people.: null
    there's no carpet in the house right now.: null
    there's nothing there to be a problem I thought,: null
    there, there were crayon marks on there: null
    they bring the, little samples: null
    they came in, and, they came in and did it and left in just no time at all,: null
    they didn't, didn't occur to them that, that they could have taken a sample: null
    they don't do that in the newer houses now: null
    they don't put brick on the side of your house just to save money: null
    they had bunk beds,: null
    they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate: null
    they had not,: null
    they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they,: null
    they have to live with that every day: null
    they just said, you can get by,: null
    they match, and all those kinds of things.: null
    they mixed, a gallon of it: null
    they obviously had been done without to much, wear afterward.: null
    they painted it kind of like a: null
    they painted our rooms all the time,: null
    they put up, a quarter inch Masonite, basically,: null
    they ruin, ,: null
    they sent their painters in to, to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then, repaint the whole ceiling,: null
    they wanted some gray to do the, to do the trim.: null
    they were white,: null
    they weren't,: null
    they're, the paint has, kind of faded and deteriorated,: null
    they're, they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in three foot lengths.: null
    ? they're, they're in pretty good condition, as far as, major repairs. lo, a lot
      of little filling holes and nicks and things like that,
    : null
    they've got this machine that matches the color of paint.: null
    this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something: null
    this is a great topic for me,: null
    this is not on the topic: null
    this is really the first, interior painting project that I've attacked.: null
    those where you built a rafter thing.: null
    tole painting is just a, something I do in my spare time: null
    two little deals,: null
    two, actually: null
    we 've have, done a little painting ourselves,: null
    we bought a house at the same time.: null
    we can't paint the chimney .: null
    we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth,: null
    we did basically seventyfive percent of the house: null
    we did it ourselves,: null
    we did the one wall but the other trim,: null
    we did too.: null
    we did, two heavy coats over it.: null
    we didn't have a problem with that.: null
    we didn't have to do any painting.: null
    we didn't have to mess with that this time.: null
    we didn't know that when we bought the house: null
    we didn't tape anything,: null
    we do, do that.: null
    we got pretty lucky on that.: null
    we got to do that this summer.: null
    we had a couple of different size brushes: null
    we had a dinner party before we started renovating it: null
    we had a, a wooden,: null
    we had all this trim to paint, and lots of it.: null
    we have a two story.: null
    we have, we have a soccer field: null
    we have, we have some more that need to be done,: null
    we haven't gotten to the point where we're hiring professionals to do too much of our needs.: null
    we just had brick on as accent: null
    we know what a job it's going to be: null
    we moved, last August: null
    we only have on, only one of our bathroom has a window in it: null
    we painted the bedroom, well within the last t, couple of months,: null
    we painted the house to,: null
    we painted, we painted the whole inside: null
    we put a flat over the top,: null
    we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off all this time,: null
    we used a latex, wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork: null
    we we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it.: null
    we went in there, one was, bu,: null
    we went to, , one of the paint stores: null
    we were painting it and trying to do, make it,: null
    we were, we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it: null
    we weren't that careful,: null
    we worked something out, because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long.: null
    we would go down: null
    we would, we put this stuff on: null
    we're about halfway through the painting process .: null
    we're energized.: null
    we're freshly graduated from school and things,: null
    we're getting a house,: null
    we're going, we're so glad we have a brick home, all we have is like trim around the windows or something,: null
    we're in the middle of the bathroom now.: null
    we're just using latex,: null
    ? we're not, you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a grainery, or something
      like that as you would be with your own house.
    : null
    we're quite satisfied with that: null
    we're, they'll be there for a while.: null
    we've definitely got all the formulas on file,: null
    we've done that the whole time we were in school. Like,: null
    we've got carpet,: null
    we've got the trim in kind of, kind of an offwhite.: null
    we've learned.: null
    we, I decided,: null
    we, our house was painted as part of the purchase contract,: null
    we, remodeled a bathroom.: null
    we, we bought this house with the idea that we were going to spend, spend a lot of time working on it,: null
    we, we built a shed over the ,: null
    we, we got this painter,: null
    we, we stocked up the first time around.: null
    ? we, we've learned to be a little more careful about covering up the floors since
      the, since the first time we spent a lot of time on the floor with a tooth,
      toothbrush and what not cleaning up.
    : null
    what I had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer,: null
    what I, what I'm trying to do is I've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms: null
    what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly.: null
    when I painted them, I didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house.: null
    ? when I start doing trim, I, I've gotten to where I, I tend to freehand it because
      ther, there's so many layers of paint on this house after forty years that,
      it, it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore,
    : null
    when he got outside, he noticed his receipt was thirteen ninetynine or something.: null
    when she called me, the computer called me, I thought that they were reading my mind.: null
    when we bought it the, it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired,: null
    when we bought our home it was recently updated.: null
    when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it.: null
    when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it.: null
    when we've painted,: null
    yet he bought seventeen gallons.: null
    you almost have to strip the whole thing,: null
    you can drip it on,: null
    you can use it on wood,: null
    you can't it all off.: null
    you can't wash it off with water.: null
    you can, you can tape them together: null
    you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape .: null
    ? you have to be, you have to be aware of what, how messy they can get and are
      they going to put on a good, a good two coats, and are they,
    : null
    you have to do that very, very carefully.: null
    you just took a roller and put it on there,: null
    you mentioned painting your bathroom.: null
    you put your sample under this thing: null
    you scrub and you scrub,: null
    you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere.: null
    you want that to look like that: null
    you want this, you want this to look like this: null
    you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something: null
    you've got like maybe, five hundred,: null
    you've got to prepare it well: null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    A lot of work,: null
    After about, half dozen coats it looks reasonable: null
    Because you might find that it's beyond, what you're willing to put into it.: null
    I couldn't imagine that they came in and painted it, the whole ceiling, just within a couple of hours.: null
    I don't think he did the interiors very well .: null
    I imagine it did.: null
    I may just be flat painting over it.: null
    I tell you what, the fumes that the, the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do any,: null
    I think that could give it a really a,: null
    I think you are, just made my project a lot easier .: null
    I wish you very good luck with it: null
    I wouldn't think so .: null
    ? I, I don't know if you get into the mind set where you just say, I'll accept
      something, or you just really have to get on their back,
    : null
    I, really think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting.: null
    I, think so .: null
    If it's paper it will probably shred.: null
    If it's really old, you don't know what it's put on with.: null
    If you don't like it all you do is put on another coat.: null
    If you take it up the next day it should be fine.: null
    It hurts your back,: null
    It makes you wonder .: null
    It wasn't too bad.: null
    It will come up a lot easier if you don't wait too long.: null
    It's kind of frustrating.: null
    It's like, it's,: null
    It, it peels the paint off when you take it off,: null
    Just, just the opposite of what everybody's, working towards now.: null
    Once you get done, you can always start over: null
    Rollers are so messy.: null
    Sears is one of the better ones.: null
    That keeps you busy.: null
    They're, they're pretty well refined today: null
    You can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape.: null
    You can work yourself to death.: null
    You could go back and, and paint,: null
    a lot of work.: null
    actually it does,: null
    boys will be boys,: null
    i, if you leave it on for weeks, it will do that.: null
    if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too.: null
    ? if that, if you discover the little tricks and tips about, how you get through
      corners and how you do trim and, how long to leave the masking tape down, because
      if you leave it too long and it dries it can flake when it, when you pull it
      up.
    : null
    interior's not so bad because it's more fun,: null
    it can be a real issue.: null
    it can be done a whole lot faster.: null
    it explains why they, why they have everything white: null
    it hurts your arm.: null
    it looked awful on .: null
    it sure makes a difference.: null
    it takes a lot of time .: null
    it's interesting that the white, makes the rooms look bigger.: null
    it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it,: null
    it's nice to have the right equipment.: null
    it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time.: null
    it's, it's not that easy.: null
    it, it seems like everybody has a, to go in and do,: null
    like you said, always takes way longer than anyone, is able to guess, because I know my husband he, he painted, when he,: null
    must be difficult,: null
    of course that's the other advantage of paint.: null
    that can make a difference,: null
    that doesn't guarantee anything .: null
    that was worth it getting a professional: null
    that would be really time, a time saver.: null
    that's easy enough.: null
    that's something that, that's worthwhile checking into then. 'Cause I,: null
    that's, that's quite a chore.: null
    that's, this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting: null
    the band saw is really nice.: null
    the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting.: null
    the whole point of using it is to save yourself work.: null
    they dry fast: null
    they look very interesting: null
    we'll see how it goes,: null
    when you start getting into colors,: null
    which might be a bigger problem than it would be,: null
    you can wash up easily because they're water soluble.: null
    you don't know what you to want to,: null
    you get some beautiful effects with them.: null
    you make up all kinds of excuses.: null
    you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend. If you have some help.: null
    you shouldn't have a, you shouldn't have a problem with it.: null

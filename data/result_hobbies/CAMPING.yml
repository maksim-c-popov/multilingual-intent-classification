    If you're going to be gone all day long, walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever: null
    In fact, when we first got married, we would try to take these trips to Minnesota to see his family: null
    Instead of getting out all that stuff,: null

    It doesn't get very cold in Texas,: null

    It is. It's, it's, it's high canyon: null
    It just gets so hot in the summer you can hardly,: null
    It really is.: null
    It was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river: null
    It was a lot of fun.: null
    It was dig your own hole: null
    It was just that bad, .: null
    It was like, no, this is not working, ,: null
    It was on the edge of the lake: null
    It was one of those, those, dome type pop up tents.: null
    It was quite nice in that respect.: null
    It was wonderful.: null
    It was, it was a marvelous experience because after that, then all I had to do was, follow the instructions, and do.: null
    It was, several years ago,: null
    It worked out particularly well, especially considering she was, six months pregnant.: null
    It would be more a tarp,: null
    It's a little trailer you pull behind your car: null
    It's a lot easier then.: null
    It's a lot of fun,: null
    It's close to the lake and close to,: null
    It's horrible.: null
    It's just amazing,: null
    It's just great.: null
    It's kind of , it's kind of the, yuppie type of camping because they have showers,: null
    It's like an oven.: null
    It's not, in the same category.: null
    It's not, it's not very deep.: null
    It's really nice,: null
    It's really very nice.: null
    It's usually like that.: null
    It's very pleasant.: null
    It's, it's on the OklahomaArkansas border.: null

    Just sat out there with our,: null
    Just the sky is so amazing.: null
    Just, just the drive up through, up the coast line: null
    K O A is, is geared for the people that have a hookup.: null
    K O A s are wonderful.: null
    Lake Joe Pool.: null
    Lake, Lake Tawakoni is a pretty nice place: null
    Last time we went, we took our vacuum cleaner with us .: null
    Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff: null
    Mine's eleven and eight.: null
    Mom did the whole, pork and beans and, the slice the potatoes and fry them outside and: null
    Mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience.: null
    Mom was always prepared: null
    Most everybody I've been talking to is from Texas,: null
    My children really enjoys it.: null
    My husband and this, other couple that we go with, her husband, kind of likes, is it scuba dive?: null
    My mother and my father split up when we were young,: null
    My motherinlaw: null
    My parents, were sailing, this last year down off, Costa Rica: null
    Nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable.: null
    Not around here .: null
    Now we have friends with a van,: null
    Of course, they drag a lot of drugs with them: null
    Of course, we didn't really rough it that much.: null
    On top of the recreational vehicles.: null
    One of the ones that you pull along: null
    One of them, , it's real nice there, a bunch of lakes around it,: null
    One thing is they don't have mosquitoes: null
    One year they were, they were just everywhere.: null
    Otherwise it's just too faint .: null
    Our children are, are grown,: null
    Our, our little group of friends here, we've been kind of getting married off and what not: null
    Right outside of Dallas.: null
    Roast marshmallows.: null

    She said yep: null
    She says that where we need to go sometime.: null
    She sleeps, she sleeps in the tent with us.: null
    She takes her, motor home.: null
    She'd think about bringing a rake so you can rake your area out.: null
    So a lot of different things.: null
    Sometimes we get a lot of people together to do it.: null
    State parks, you get a little bit fearful too, things like that simply because it, they are supposed to be patrolled: null
    Take a twentytwo: null
    That can be a mess.: null
    ? That really gave us a lot more space, floor space so, } you did not have to
      be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around
    : null
    That sounds interesting.: null
    That would make me nervous .: null
    That's beautiful.: null
    That's four each.: null
    That's how I define camping .: null
    That's not the kind we do.: null
    That's okay.: null
    That's one thing my husband wanted to do, was, on this summer's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went.: null
    That's probably where I first started, was in Girl Scouts.: null
    That's sort of the same thing that, that I do.: null
    That's the only time you really use your campground.: null
    That's what I would do.: null
    That's what my girlfriend says.: null
    That's what we have, too.: null
    That's when we camped the most.: null
    The days, get up into the high eighties, maybe the nineties: null
    The last time I went camping was about, in the middle of October,: null
    The more times we did it, the more serious we get about it.: null
    The only thing we'd had to do, we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill,: null
    The way it works.: null
    The, the last one we did, was, was a canoe trip in Arkansas: null
    The, the movie, THE DOORS, has so, some nice desert scenes,: null
    Then when we started having children we bought a camper.: null
    Then you have to get up the next day and move it on.: null
    There is, course, the the Grand Canyon: null
    There's lots of places if you're going to go camping.: null
    There's someone at the door.: null
    There's the Apostle Islands,: null
    There's, a thing called Pfeiffer Rim.: null
    There's, there's a little lake up there: null
    These people were with us.: null
    They are very nice.: null
    They could, they would all the time they wanted,: null
    They didn't have phone lines.: null
    They ended up helping several other people though that were, that were stuck.: null
    They have some wonderful camping areas there.: null
    They have swimming pools, things like that.: null
    They have, screened in areas,: null
    They just don't have them: null
    They like to get out there: null
    They really do.: null
    They said they've got the white beaches and the sand,: null
    They suggested that we, discuss what we think of when we say camping.: null
    They were so impressed.: null
    They will if you attack them.: null
    They're about three hours away if you go due north.: null
    They're on the increase in this area.: null
    They're plastic: null
    ? They've, they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more
      of them, because they were, increasing so much.
    : null
    They, they must, work on that,: null
    This cave that we used to go in was little,: null
    This summer we went to, the Smokey Mountain National Park.: null
    Tyler is really, really a neat place to camp.: null
    Tyler, we sort of got spoiled with, I think.: null
    Usually try to have a, occasionally a camp fire at night, and: null
    Very comfortable,: null
    W, we were looking at those in a magazine.: null
    Want one bad.: null
    We always check and see if we should answer the door,: null
    We are talking about starting camping again in the fall.: null
    We camped at the beach one time: null
    We couldn't find a place to camp: null
    We decided that was easier than cots and more comfortable.: null
    We did a lot of different things.: null
    We did it for years and years,: null
    We didn't have a phone.: null
    We didn't have to go with sleeping bags.: null
    We do an awful lot of camping.: null
    We don't go for the long, week long thing.: null
    We drove down to Port Aransas,: null
    We enjoyed it.: null
    We found this one area that doesn't have mosquitoes.: null
    We got one of those kind that have got the,: null
    We had a good time.: null
    We had taken our electric,: null
    We had the steaks on the grill.: null
    We have a little bit: null
    We have a tent.: null
    We have some of them around here.: null
    We just didn't take enough blankets and: null
    We just lived up there.: null
    We just moved to a new hou, into a house,: null
    We just sort of lit them.: null
    We just use trail tarps.: null
    We just used to have balls.: null
    We kind of slowed down a little bit.: null
    We kind of took, a tour of the United States for about a week,: null
    We normally,: null
    ? We recently moved from the Rocky Mountain area up in, northern Utah down to
      here because of work, and, haven't been able to enjoy fishing like I used to
      up there, which is, clear water fishing and streams and, and rivers.
    : null
    We started out,: null
    We take extension cords: null
    We take, we take our dog camping.: null
    We took, just our little tents,: null
    We used to live in Utah: null
    We went to the: null
    We went, we took the southern route and went, went through, the Grand Canyon, again: null
    We were in the, we were in the woods,: null
    We would get up in the morning, go skiing,: null
    We'd always,: null
    We'd stop when we wanted to, that kind of stuff.: null
    We're close enough so they can do that,: null
    We're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way.: null
    We're on our third one I think.: null
    We've been lucky.: null
    We've been wanting to start camping again this year too.: null
    We've even seen people with these campers: null
    We've got an electric pump that hooks into the cigarette lighter.: null
    We've got cook stoves: null
    We've got some land at Holly Lake: null
    We've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis: null
    We've never really been rained on the few times we've gone.: null
    We've, we've done tent camping,: null
    We, we try to, go with another couple that have children also.: null
    We, we, we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped: null
    We, when the children were smaller we used to go to, Delaware along the o, ocean most every year.: null
    We, years ago we lived in Oklahoma: null
    When I think of camping I think of, of bugs , and sleeping bags and, and tents, along the Appalachian Trail.: null
    When you have a small child because they don't want to get up at three in the morning: null
    Where they're doing this program. The Voice Recognition Program.: null
    You couldn't,: null
    You have got four hours of day light, good skiing left.: null
    You just couldn't get phones.: null
    You just couldn,: null
    You just get used to it.: null
    You've got the showers available.: null
    a group of friends that I, I went to college with, got together: null
    a lot of our friends in east, will go to east Texas in the summer and camp: null
    a lot of our friends will,: null
    a lot of people I know are,: null
    a lot of people do say I sound like,: null
    a, a storm came in: null
    about nineteen eightytwo I moved from Rapid City in the Black Hills,: null
    about the fourth day, I thought, if I don't get a hot tub and: null
    actually the, the Blue Ridge in Virginia are closer to Raleigh.: null
    ? actually they've, I remember, they have taken the, the du, the heavy cast iron
      dutch ovens and done their cooking there over the fire,
    : null
    after he took that merit badge, he did all the shopping and preparing, getting ready for it.: null
    almost destroyed the ch, the in one town, because of the mosquitoes,: null
    also while I was growing up, we did have a trailer,: null
    also, we had done some camping in Colorado, in the mountains,: null
    although I've stayed in K O A campgrounds, we've never done that just to go around and camp.: null
    always at the beginning I did all the shopping and everything.: null
    anyway that's their life .: null
    appreciate it.: null
    as I said, it just rained every time.: null
    as a little girl I'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother,: null
    as adults, it's like if I don't take a shower every day, I feel like,: null
    ? as far as camping, my wife and I have plans to, not really camp per se, but
      to drive up the, Highway One there in California
    : null
    ? as far as the camping part of that, we just drag along all our tents and sleeping
      bags and, find, find a clearing in the woods and go for it.
    : null
    at night it was so cold, you thought you'd never feel your,: null
    by Friday night I just want to crash,: null
    by the time we really get a chance to it's July,: null
    by then, of course, I was able to catch, catch some things,: null
    camping in Death Valley,: null
    cooled off,: null
    copperheads mostly,: null
    couldn't believe,: null
    couple of friends, couple of my high school friends and I, we'd go camping out by a river, of course, and, and go fishing,: null
    course it, it has all of those qualities: null
    course, the, the Sequoias and the Redwoods and , and you get up into Bryce Canyon and Yellowstone: null
    curling iron.: null
    daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish for breakfast: null
    during the summer we camp, two or three weeks a year .: null
    during the summer we would camp out at the lake.: null
    especially in the tent: null
    especially there was a little store close by,: null
    even I would kind of like to go.: null
    even at that, it, it was like the first time that I ventured,: null
    even when you're eating,: null
    even, even when in Oklahoma when we camped I really didn't notice a problem with bugs.: null
    ever once, on my summer vacation, my weeklong vacation, I,: null
    every Friday night they'll go home, straight from work: null
    everybody was getting stuck in the mud.: null
    everybody's got their sleeping bags,: null
    everything was very convenient: null
    everywhere you went there was sand.: null
    find a creek.: null
    from what I understand from them it's really, really pretty there.: null
    gave us a place to stack things during the day: null
    getting out and enjoying nature and each other as company when we're out camping.: null
    getting out into nature and relaxing,: null
    he did have a problem, when he went camping last year in Beavers Bend, Ok, Oklahoma,: null
    he didn't realize he was touching poison ivy: null
    he got poison ivy,: null
    he graduated and went off to college: null
    he is a couple years older than me: null
    he just decided to take the kids out there.: null
    he just, he just tows it behind his truck.: null
    he manages the troops: null
    he said that you can, a lot of times you can go for, a good day before you'll see or meet anybody else on the trail.: null
    he'd always tell us, okay, look for, a nice flat little area where we can pitch our tents,: null
    he, he's got three kids,: null
    his kids will sleep in the truck, in the, in the back of the bed.: null
    hopefully get up there early enough to, to get into some of the, some of the fish and, the, the good weather and what not.: null
    hopefully we'd catch our supper,: null
    if he would buy her a motor home .: null
    if the setting was right and that, it's, it's great,: null
    if they say I, I, we just type it in like that.: null
    if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles, .: null
    if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on.: null
    if you get a chance,: null
    in Padre Island and in a: null
    in Texas that is where we camp basically.: null
    in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped,: null
    in fact, it even had, had a little refrigerator, and the whole business.: null
    in fact, last month we went camping,: null
    in fact, the, the more urban we get with the television and the cabin and the whole bit, it loses it's flavor.: null
    in the Summer .: null
    in the afternoon, it is still four o'clock.: null
    ? in the hills we, we would do like you di, you folks did, you folks did, would
      take the nature hikes and, and look for animals,
    : null
    in the hills, you can see quite a few different animals,: null
    in, in the early fall time,: null
    interesting enough, the food part was kind of, important thing in our camping.: null
    is that hot camping.: null
    it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just don't find anyway else except in a desert.: null
    it always had to be somewhere near a, a river so we could go fishing,: null
    it blows air out instead of sucking it in: null
    it came, just a torrential downpour.: null
    it ended up, when it came time for us to pull in for the night, we'd take a vote.: null
    it got all into his eye: null
    it got really cold at night,: null
    it had two double beds in it.: null
    it has since come down.: null
    it has some really wonderful, sights that are in the wooded areas.: null
    it held our pan and, the potatoes and stuff.: null
    it is a fortyfive minute drive to the mountains: null
    it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment: null
    it is not bad.: null
    it is not horrible,: null
    it just depends on where you go,: null
    it really is.: null
    it really was, it was great.: null
    it seemed like it rained every weekend for about a y, the year we were really into camping.: null
    it started raining really heavy: null
    it surrounds a manmade reservoir: null
    it was a big embankment,: null
    it was a little too late for the fish: null
    it was a nine by twelve.: null
    it was about four years ago, my little boy was three months old: null
    it was all right,: null
    it was all year,: null
    it was always fun,: null
    it was at a camp.: null
    it was beautiful, beautiful few days.: null
    it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream.: null
    it was enough for all five of us, six of us.: null
    it was fantastic.: null
    it was great.: null
    it was just really nice, that time of year.: null
    it was just, it was just a really nice place to camp.: null
    it was like, kind of like a little, little, gully: null
    it was married cousins,: null
    it was more: null
    it was never quite the same thing.: null
    it was overlooking the water: null
    it was pretty nice.: null
    it was raining,: null
    it was real hilly.: null
    it was really nice.: null
    it was really swollen: null
    it was really, it was neat sitting there watching it,: null
    it was small: null
    it was so, pick your own, blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast .: null
    it was still, it was still, too, cold.: null
    it was the most bonding, most wonderful time.: null
    it was there before they built the dam.: null
    it was wonderful.: null
    it was, it was always fun.: null
    it was, it was more fun.: null
    it was, it was pre, it was pretty challenging.: null
    it wasn't a creek bed,: null
    it wasn't even a, a full tent.: null
    it wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove .: null
    it won't take but just a, just a quick look at a map to find where those mountains are,: null
    it worked pretty well.: null
    it works real good.: null
    it would have slept three adults anyway.: null
    it would just absolutely taste wonderful.: null
    it's a dome tent.: null
    it's a new park.: null
    it's a real, it's a real nice place to go and camp,: null
    it's a very short drive to areas near here.: null
    it's all over him.: null
    it's also, pretty challenging,: null
    it's beautiful in February.: null
    it's completely undeveloped at this point,: null
    it's divided up into ten lots.: null
    it's easy to keep him occupied though on land.: null
    it's gorgeous,: null
    it's got one of those wildlife parks.: null
    it's interesting,: null
    it's is something that I've done in the past.: null
    it's just a piece of material that has, that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it: null
    it's just about twelve miles south of, the New York border.: null
    it's just almost surreal, in some places.: null
    it's just beautiful.: null
    it's just brilliant.: null
    it's just pretty much the two of us who do things.: null
    it's just wonderful not to be bugged all night long with a humming mosquito at your ear,: null
    it's like virtually anything.: null
    it's like, this, this is, this is what, a pheasant looks like,: null
    it's nice to, to get away.: null
    it's not real populated so they can, they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean.: null
    it's not something I'd want to do real often.: null
    it's not that bad: null
    it's not very many miles from our house at all.: null
    it's not, it's not too bad.: null
    it's one of those popups.: null
    it's pretty funny,: null
    it's pretty nice.: null
    it's really nice.: null
    it's really, really nice.: null
    it's right on a big lake,: null
    it's so hot.: null
    it's some pretty country up there.: null
    it's sort of like that,: null
    it's still pretty chilly.: null
    it's the water he's not scared of.: null
    it's very peaceful.: null
    it's, it gets kind of chilly it can get chilly.: null
    it's, it has dinosaur tracks,: null
    it's, it's a little bit different.: null
    it's, it's been real interesting, the different personalities .: null
    it's, it's camping.: null
    it's, it's fun: null
    it's, it's handy to, to station yourself there on the land: null
    it's, it's hard .: null
    it's, it's just kind of nice.: null
    it's, it's pretty isolated,: null
    it's, it's quite bearable: null
    ? it's, it's, in terms of north, south I would say it's, a little, a little more
      towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half
      of it.
    : null
    it, , everything was sopping wet inside the tent.: null
    it, even though, it wasn't hunting season,: null
    it, it always rained on us.: null
    it, it was always an enjoyable experience.: null
    it, it was always fun.: null
    it, it was in your bed .: null
    it, it was pretty early in the year.: null
    it, it's just a lot of trees,: null
    its, its, its, mosquitoes are terrible: null
    just some of them are known: null
    just the very second,: null
    last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week,: null
    last year in, we camped in a tent,: null
    last year it was the end of July: null
    last year they camped in tents,: null
    let's see. I just, I just like to go: null
    like I mentioned, the, we, we've been camping a couple of times this year: null
    like I say, they're kind of, just kind of more than anything,: null
    lots of times we don't even take tents.: null
    lots, a lot of people I've talked to have said, isn't camping boring?: null
    ? mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and, and just going
      out and seeing what there was to see, in the area.
    : null
    maybe camp another night and drive home.: null
    maybe my, dropping my phone.: null
    maybe next time he'll stay away from those particular ,: null
    ? maybe, like you said, start out slow and, and kind of get used to it, and find
      out that it, maybe it's not as bad as I, I fear it might be .
    : null
    me, I outgrew, sleeping bags and, tents,: null
    most of my camping,: null
    most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel.: null
    most of them have pretty good facilities.: null
    most time they run away from you: null
    my baby's getting sick.: null
    my bones are getting so old,: null
    my brother has a real nice popup.: null
    my buddy and I, we just camped .: null
    my cou, husband and, and his uncle especially, grew up camping together,: null
    my dad and I went out sometimes: null
    my dad loved fishing and camping.: null
    my dad would take us,: null
    my ex decided, we're going to try camping: null
    my folks had a cabin at one time at Lake Tenkiller: null
    my husband and I, his, he says his idea now of roughing it is the Regency Hyatt.: null
    my husband has even camped at Lake Lavon: null
    my husband's parents were really avid campers as well.: null
    my inlaws also had a camper, or, a pop up tent, one of those trailer tops: null
    my mom goes camping: null
    my mother wasn't into that,: null
    my oldest child is a girl, was born three years ago, three and a half.: null
    my parents were real avid campers: null
    my sisterinlaw, she's always done a lot of camping.: null
    my son is not eager to go: null
    my wife said, we're moving.: null
    my wife's from the western part of Virginia,: null
    my wife's real excited about it,: null
    my, my husband is a good camper: null
    normally I go with a whole group of friends: null
    not around here.: null
    not that much.: null
    not, camping or anything.: null
    noth, nothing overly strenuous.: null
    now I haven't so that,: null
    now I like to go out several times a year.: null
    now all my life is more like camping than not camping really.: null
    now that we have children and we go every blue moon,: null
    now we'll go look for one.: null
    now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports.: null
    of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things: null
    of course, there's lots of mountains around there to camp in, and, and streams and stuff.: null
    of course, we see smaller animals all the time,: null
    once they're there: null
    one doesn't go in July .: null
    one night we were camping: null
    one of them I don't really consider camping.: null
    one thing that is a big concern in the evening, at night, is, make sure that all the food's put away and so forth: null
    one thing, I've done all sorts of camping.: null
    one time we went to Yellowstone: null
    one, one thing you said about the stars is really true: null
    or, take a deck of cards if we can actually see and, play cards and stuff.: null
    our camper do, doesn't have an air conditioner.: null
    our children are both grown: null
    our children liked, liked it quite well.: null
    our truck was back.: null
    part of them are.: null
    ? personally, I, when I, when we were growing up and when we were going camping,
      I thought that was a little too structured of a camp ground.
    : null
    probably the, the last one that I went to California: null
    really just commune with nature.: null
    right now, what we did, my wife and I, is we got a mobile home.: null
    roughing it for me is going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower.: null
    see, I see, they just want to get away.: null
    she brought everything from, like I said, toilet paper to the rake.: null
    she has a lot of fun.: null
    she loves that place.: null
    she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing.: null
    she said out to the trailer.: null
    she shows dogs: null
    she was, she is always prepared,: null
    she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent.: null
    she'd bring along, something, because tradition had it we would never catch anything,: null
    she's good.: null
    she's got one of these huge Winnebago's with a refrigerator and airconditioning, color T V, microwave oven: null
    she, she goes to dog shows.: null
    she, takes the motor home .: null
    since I've been married and with a family, we have to go where there's restrooms .: null
    since I've had children it has changed a little bit,: null
    since the beginning.: null
    since we've been married, we just go, we go real often to Colorado to the mountains,: null
    so far my wife and I have pretty much had to stick with tent camping.: null
    so far, New Orleans is far west as I've gotten.: null
    some friends of mine and I are planning to camp this summer, for four days.: null
    some of the time we would not allow them to take friends along so that it was just the four of us.: null
    some of them are pretty rough.: null
    some of them are really nice: null
    some of them aren't,: null
    ? some, I think some people that had fairly sturdy, vehicles or whatever if they
      had like a Winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water,
      I think they stayed.
    : null
    something that's smaller would be a lot more convenient.: null
    sometime, I like to go to Eisenhower up on Lake Texoma.: null
    sorry to say,: null
    ? sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger, we invested
      in some stacking, cots, that were like bunk, bunk beds,
    : null
    th, I'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women.: null
    that I wouldn't know: null
    that got kind of rough sometimes .: null
    that just out in the woods,: null
    that kind of puts a little bit of a hamper on your,: null
    that makes it a lot more enjoyable.: null
    that might be some place where my husband and I can go.: null
    that substituted for a shower: null
    that was a new experience for me: null
    that was back before: null
    that was fun: null
    that was great.: null
    ? that was mainly for people in motor homes or, or had trailers or, and so on
      and so forth, where, we really wanted to go camping in a tent
    : null
    that was nice.: null
    that was real nice.: null
    that was sort of miserable.: null
    that was, it's a really nice area,: null
    that was, that was pretty good: null
    that way I can sleep in the van and be more comfortable .: null
    that would be, that would be pretty nice.: null
    that's a possibility.: null
    that's been real enjoyable for them.: null
    that's good.: null
    that's how I camp too.: null
    that's how we got started.: null
    that's kind of changed now.: null
    that's my first trip back in, goodness, thirty years maybe .: null
    that's right.: null
    that's the whole thing that everyone told me,: null
    that's true.: null
    that's what I do when I wait for a phone call,: null
    that's what ours is.: null
    that's what we camp in.: null
    that's where we, that's where I am,: null
    that's who I stayed with.: null
    that's, that was, that's always been our next step.: null
    that, that particular one was a two day trip: null
    that, that, that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away.: null
    the , when I was a, a teenager and growing up, that was sleeping bags: null
    the Blue Ridge in North Carolina I think are much nicer: null
    the Grand Tetons are gorgeous, too.: null
    the Painted Desert is, is real pretty, in a different sort of way.: null
    the boys are, our boys are old enough now,: null
    the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and: null
    the camping I grew up with was like tents and Coleman stove type.: null
    the campsite that we went to was an area that,: null
    the days were nice and warm: null
    the facilities are quite nice: null
    the first time I left him we went overnight camping.: null
    the first time I was there, the, the tree was still standing,: null
    the girls can play on the beach area .: null
    the kids and I like to go out and camp in the tent.: null
    the kids like to go out, as often as they can.: null
    the last time was in October: null
    the last time we went was in, I guess it was, it was hunting season,: null
    the little tent comes up the top: null
    the majority of my camping experience is, a tent by the lake type situation or, maybe a canoe trip or something like that.: null
    the minute the sun went down, the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out.: null
    the next night they'll stay at the motel, or something like that.: null
    the nights are reasonably warm, sixties or seventies.: null
    the one time that I did go camping when I was about, I guess sixteen or seventeen with my family,: null
    the one time that we went, we got one,: null
    the only site left when we got there was in the middle of a field,: null
    ? the part that I did was more fun than, than labor because they did the, the
      running and toting chores and I just helped cook and kind of organize,
    : null
    the population's been really up.: null
    the river was, it was up about three feet: null
    the second day head on down to the, to the pool at the end of the river.: null
    the stars were just five feet above you.: null
    the water rushed down: null
    the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime.: null
    the, camper had, beds in it,: null
    the, i, it gets cooler when the sun sets: null
    the, the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his, cooking merit badge in,: null
    the, the shots are, are pretty nice: null
    the, the, the no telephone, the,: null
    theirs was so bad,: null
    then I moved to North Carolina: null
    then later my mom and dad got a camper: null
    then we'd roast, roast marshmallows,: null
    then when you look underneath them, it's just got these little wheels and this little axle,: null
    then you're talking about six to eight hours.: null
    there are some really nice camping areas, up in the Wichitas, which is in Oklahoma: null
    there is one that's out in this big lake: null
    there is, not really camping,: null
    there was a playground for them: null
    there was certainly nothing like a, a bathroom, a shower or anything,: null
    there was just copperheads everywhere.: null
    there was nobody else,: null
    there was, state park.: null
    there was, there was four of us kids,: null
    there wasn't any electricity on the camp site: null
    there were two other couples with us: null
    there's a couple of national parks, I guess, that you can camp at.: null
    there's a golf course and, just a whole bunch of camping sites.: null
    there's a lot of boating out there,: null
    there's a ridge that goes down from Tennessee: null
    there's also, what we found, in the state of, South Dakota, the Black Hills.: null
    there's no bugs,: null
    there's no bugs.: null
    there's no hills,: null
    there's plenty of room to hold things.: null
    there's really no time of the year that you can't go.: null
    there's some pretty decent campgrounds , I don't think Raleigh, I don't think the state of North Carolina takes,: null
    there's some real nice ones in Arkansas.: null
    there's this little mountain lakes: null
    there's this, there's this other one more up in the mountains: null
    there's woods and things out in East Texas: null
    there's, a lot of trees, lot of mountains, and lot of, hiking sort of things: null
    there's, places in Wisconsin.: null
    there's, there's a outfitter: null
    there, there are quite a few, parks, I guess, state parks,: null
    they all come out.: null
    they are huge.: null
    they can't believe that they could survive it.: null
    they did build a dam on it,: null
    they do a lot of camping with the scouts: null
    they do the work: null
    they don't have a shower room or anything,: null
    they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep.: null
    they don't,: null
    they ended up getting out.: null
    they enjoy it.: null
    they even, they had a library at one time out there.: null
    they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their T V when they're going.: null

    they had swings,: null
    they had the time of their lives,: null
    they had to get out of there.: null

    they have showers and full bathrooms,: null
    they have things for kids to do.: null
    they hear desert: null
    they just, they just thoroughly enjoy it.: null
    they like to play in them.: null
    they love to go camping.: null
    they pop up pretty fast.: null
    they really do, they have a great time,: null
    they really enjoy it too.: null
    they really made it hard to hunt them.: null
    they said they looked down and there went: null
    they sleep in the popup.: null
    they they decided that, that was enough camping for the weekend.: null
    they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry, and lack of water,: null
    they took about two weeks and went into,: null
    they turn them over to somebody: null
    they went white water rafting: null
    they were all, everybody was trying to flee the campsite,: null
    they were cots, fold up cots.: null
    they were just right there.: null
    they were plagued, they were plagued with them, with mosquitoes.: null
    they were so close to the water that the water was coming up,: null
    they'll leave,: null
    they'll pack up: null
    they're certainly not up to a standard of a K O A where it's, a little bit cleaner.: null
    they're going to spend about a week and a half camping up there,: null
    ? they're going to, I guess they're going to try to teach computers how to recognize
      voices and search for specific words and stuff.
    : null
    they're grown now.: null
    they're involved in the scouting: null
    they're not really cabins, I wouldn't say,: null

    they're twelve and eleven,: null
    they're very light weight: null
    they're, they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping.: null

    we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains.: null
    we have leantos up here.: null

    what is it called, Cedar Hill.: null
    ? what was so fun though is that I had to take my son to the doctor this morning
      because he went out camping with some friends
    : null
    ? what we were doing, we were just going to say, we're just going to sleep in
      the tent and hang out at night, so, no going in and out, and, or what he wants
      to do,
    : null
    what, that was one of the things I really thought I'd like to do with my children,: null
    when I got married, my husband had always backpacked.: null
    ? when my husband and I were, camping, we'd take this domed tent that, is easily
      collapsible and, go camping and, just kind of roughed it.
    : null
    when my oldest son,: null
    when the kids were little we were in, we were in New Jersey, and w,: null
    when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van,: null
    when we called home, everybody said, we were worried about you in that storm ...: null
    when we can go to a cabin as long as we've got running water: null
    when we did it with our children, we lived in, Tennessee: null
    when we were younger, when I was a kid, we camped in Virginia: null
    when we, before we had kids, we was in a motorcycle group,: null
    when you're close to a big city like Dallas, the, the lights kind of wash,: null
    when, I was, a child, we went regular old camping, tents and: null
    when, when we go camping here,: null
    with kids they don't care if they take a shower everyday.: null
    with our children, we did, we had a pop up tent camper.: null
    wow, I don't know what that was.: null
    ye, in the winter time yes,: null
    yeah, you can, if you can reverse the,: null
    you can fill them up that way: null
    you can go out, outside in the daytime, all right,: null
    you can pick those up going west,: null
    you can sneak a dog into a motel: null
    you can't keep the dirt out of the tent.: null
    you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel.: null
    you carry them with you,: null
    you did not have to, to be hauling things out of your, the trunk of you car,: null
    you do actually camp.: null
    you don't have to go very far.: null
    you don't want them up that early.: null
    you dumped everything in together: null
    you get up when it gets light .: null
    you go to bed when it gets dark,: null
    you got to, you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what's going to happen.: null
    you hear people talk about the Little Dipper.: null
    you just pick a campground on the river,: null
    you just put them together.: null
    you really can probably count thousands of stars,: null
    you would get your book and just kind of cuddle up.: null
    you're getting fad, you're fading out.: null
    your canoeing kind of made me think of that.: null
    your hair dryer: null
    your, you said your family was gro, all grown up now,: null
    '} it''s like what are you interested in,': null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    A little bit in the world.: null
    Apparently, an earth quake caused it.: null
    Because it gets, it really does get expensive if you, if you don't want to rough it all the way.: null
    I bet it's pretty over there.: null
    I bet you that's an experience there.: null
    I don't know how you can really keep, the inside of a tent clean.: null
    I don't think I, I've got quite enough nerve to do that.: null
    I guess probably just wherever you live at has a lot to do with where, what you're going to do when you go,: null
    I guess that's God's place, too.: null
    I guess that's it for camping, .: null
    I guess we've talked as much as we need to on the subject.: null
    I guess, I have, I guess more of a twang,: null
    I just don't understand these people that think taking an R V,: null
    I know you would.: null
    I still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family,: null
    I think Arkansas has one of the best parks departments around.: null
    I think it's a little bit further north, when I think about it.: null
    I think it's much nicer when you can really get out far enough away where,: null
    I think so.: null
    I think that'll be fun.: null
    I think that's a little bit mor, more east, further east, and and maybe south, if I am remembering where that is.: null
    I think that,: null
    I think the worst, the worst thing is when it's raining.: null
    I think the, there's certainly a lot of aspects you would like,: null
    I think we fulfilled our obligation.: null
    I thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because,: null
    I would need that before I could teach them .: null
    I'd say I camp quite a bit.: null
    I'm just a chicken.: null
    ? I'm just sitting here list, listening to your accent and thinking what a good
      time the computer is going to have with that.
    : null
    I, I don't think I do,: null
    I, I think our experience of camping is,: null
    If you don't you'll find every rock on it when you: null
    If you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping: null
    It is beautiful.: null
    It really is.: null
    It takes a lot more planning.: null
    It's just, it's a lot of work, too: null
    It's not camping.: null
    It's pretty fun.: null
    It's wonderful for them to be outside.: null
    Just get you away from the everyday things that are going on.: null
    Like I said, we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas.: null
    ? Like, like you say it can be, a water ski trip, or fishing trip or just a sightseeing,
      bird watching, hunt, hunt with a camera type of thing
    : null
    Nice and quick and easy to put up.: null
    Once you start them, they enjoy it all their lives.: null
    ? Other than, taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something and,
      and sweeping it out everyday, it's really hard to, to keep the sand and dirt
      out of it.
    : null
    Packs away nice and small: null
    Place is forested with c, with those concrete trees.: null
    That doesn't go along with camping,: null
    That is a really pretty state park.: null
    That makes a difference.: null
    That sounds like it'd be fun.: null
    That would be exciting.: null
    That would be fun though to go.: null
    That would be really great.: null
    That's kind of, kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping.: null
    That's neat,: null
    That's really pretty out there.: null
    That's, that's a great place to go camping,: null
    That's, that's pretty average to me .: null
    The Rocky Mountains are so much,: null
    The Yankees can hear it.: null
    The rest, the rest of that is re, really not the same.: null
    There are a lot of nice places,: null
    There's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere.: null
    They seem to be trailing out quickly.: null
    Those aren't too pleasant.: null
    With kids they don't care, a l, about a lot of things.: null
    Years ago it would have been fine: null
    You can get the, they have some nice camping grounds: null
    You have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff,: null
    You probably have more there, though, I would imagine.: null
    You'd like it very much.: null
    You're not old at all.: null
    You're really roughing it.: null
    You've got a phone obviously .: null
    Your camping experience is probably,: null
    a big windstorm it would pick you up.: null
    a nice tent on the, the shore of a lake,: null
    a pool to go to.: null
    about had to be something like that getting around in a Pinto.: null
    at a time when they're afraid of their shadow all they need is, some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent,: null
    easy to pick up and go, and, s,: null
    especially in East Texas, it's really nice.: null
    even the sleeping bags, those are running, a good thirty dollars a pop,: null
    ever, everybody might learn something that way,: null
    for instance,: null
    get out of, get out of the city for awhile.: null
    hike up those mountains: null
    i, i, if I have one, it must be very, very slight.: null
    in those those kinds of situations, room rent which is outrageous.: null
    it has to be.: null
    it is neat though because there are lots of lakes, fairly near by,: null
    it is neat.: null
    it seems like an unusual subject this time of the year: null
    it sure beats driving a thousand miles, to , to find a mountain, I guess.: null
    it was a neat activity.: null
    it's a lot of work to set up just for one night.: null
    it's a, that is a particularly neat area for camping because,: null
    it's easy for you to go.: null
    it's fun, too, I think.: null
    it's good to get out and smell some fresh air, too.: null
    it's like, my: null
    it's not for the faint of heart, I don't think.: null
    it's not really, I guess, camping the way peop, most people picture camping in the tent: null
    it's real lovely.: null
    it's really hard to get away: null
    it's really is a, is a good, good family thing,: null
    it's really strange.: null
    it's relaxing.: null
    it's sort of interesting.: null
    it's still, it's real different not to have another adult with you.: null
    it's, get, getting ready and taking care of everything.: null
    it's, it's a lot like camping.: null
    it's, it's really quite pretty.: null
    it's, it's really refreshing.: null
    it, it just puts a damper on things for a little while.: null
    just set it up: null
    kind of makes you appreciate some, a lot of the things you take for granted.: null
    maybe not the, the Canada men's trip, but some other,: null
    money's precious.: null
    motor homes can be a lot of fun.: null
    probably spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in Texas.: null
    really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring, and, in, in the fall.: null
    that can be a lot of fun, too.: null
    that is God's country,: null
    that is is to have a, a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it, plus your tent.: null
    that is it .: null
    that makes a big difference.: null
    that place is great,: null
    that seems,: null
    that sounds a little less fierce than bears.: null
    that sounds like fun .: null
    that sounds like fun.: null
    that sounds that my, my kind of camping, it really does.: null
    that would, that would be much.: null
    that'd be a lot of fun.: null
    that's a, that's a neat area.: null
    that's just about as bad as a kid .: null
    that's right.: null
    the first, first couple of times it's pretty scary: null
    the hiking is just really great.: null
    the kids love it.: null
    the, the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find.: null
    there is just no way I've not picked one up.: null
    there is lots of pretty country further west.: null
    there is lots to see .: null
    there is, there's an awful lot of things set up, just any, anything you want to do.: null
    there's a Tyler State Park that's, really a nice camping area,: null
    there's a lot of different opportunities for things like that.: null
    there's a lot of places with, nature trails,: null
    there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at .: null
    there's no T V,: null
    ? there's that sense of it, you're kind of scared, that risk of what could happen
      and then the thrill of, the excitement of doing it,
    : null
    there, supposedly,: null
    they always say it sleeps more than it does.: null
    they don't have all these modern toys,: null
    they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like,: null
    they just love it.: null
    they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might.: null
    they probably live in a city also,: null
    they'd be awake all night.: null
    they're also, flimsy when you really look at them.: null
    they're really terrible.: null
    they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them, usually.: null
    they're, they're not bad.: null
    this is my, my Gemini nature, {D you know,: null
    those, they're kind of nice: null
    time is precious,: null
    when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty,: null
    when you get inside they're really nice,: null
    when you have to have it, you have got to have it.: null
    you can talk about that a lot,: null
    you don't, you don't sound like it to me.: null
    you're not old .: null

    I'm on an internship up here for a year: null
    I'm real, a real cat lover.: null
    I'm really allergic to them,: null
    I'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person, no, it wouldn't have worked.: null
    I'm taking care of his dog: null
    I'm the only one that pays attention to him.: null
    I'm unable to, to, really take care of a pet: null
    I'm used, I'm used to having cats around,: null
    I'm very comfortable,: null
    I'm wondering if, if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year.: null
    I'm working on a bachelor's degree.: null
    I'm writing it out phonetically,: null
    I'm, I love gardening: null
    I'm, I really fear for the breed because I love that breed,: null
    I'm, I'm a dog person.: null
    I'm, I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force: null
    ? I'm, I'm kind of glad to be able to tell people about this, but you, because
      you all the time, run into people with problems.
    : null
    I'm, I'm kind of in a wheelchair,: null
    I'm, I'm looking for another cat for them.: null
    I've been doing it for about two weeks: null
    I've been to Charleston.: null
    I've come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor.: null
    I've got a little doggy, that I've had quite, quite a long time.: null
    I've got a male Siamese about a year old here.: null
    I've got some applications,: null
    I've got these two cats that hang around with me all day,: null
    I've had a Burmese python,: null
    I've had a retriever.: null
    I've had a skunk: null
    I've had cats growing up all the time: null
    I've had dogs in the past: null
    I've had dogs through the years.: null
    I've had gerbils,: null
    I've had him probably five years.: null
    I've had mice: null
    I've had rats,: null
    I've had several cats.: null
    I've had this dog now for, for sixteen years: null
    I've had to get it from Oklahoma.: null
    I've had, I have had a number of them in my lifetime: null
    I've just never s, seen the attraction of having fish.: null
    I've never had one that I could keep in the house before and tolerate it .: null
    I've never heard anything about it either.: null
    I've never owned one , since I,: null
    I've never seen two cats so close.: null
    I've put in the paper work, I just never made the call.: null
    I've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb,: null
    I've seen them.: null
    I've seen those.: null
    I've, I live right across the street from a, a big lake here,: null
    I've, I was always kind of nondescript in that category because I always liked dogs.: null
    I've, I've got incoming calls: null
    I, I couldn't see having fish like that.: null
    I, I didn't even tell the apartment manager,: null
    I, I don't know that I'd, that I'd trade my dog in for the world.: null
    I, I favor dogs over cats actually: null
    I, I feel real guilty because we had him, for six years: null
    I, I glanced at the clock when, we started: null
    I, I grew up on a farm: null
    I, I grew up with cats: null
    I, I guess I really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them,: null
    I, I had a, for many years I had a dog that was part Springer Spaniel.: null
    I, I had never really had a Golden retriever before.: null
    I, I hate to cut it off,: null
    I, I have a dog that God gave us too, .: null
    I, I have a sixteen year old, almost sixteen year old Golden Retriever,: null
    I, I have some neighbors across the field,: null
    I, I have to tell you about our most interesting pet, though.: null
    I, I have two cats right now.: null
    I, I j, I actually live in Florida: null
    I, I just knew today, that we looked at the pound, and that we just went all over the place,: null
    I, I just never understood why, what the attraction,: null
    I, I like the way they come up: null
    I, I live alone in an apartment,: null
    I, I live alone now: null
    I, I live in an apartment building: null
    I, I really like them.: null
    I, I see other people out there: null
    I, I sure wasn't good at training it: null
    ? I, I think, in a way we're able to read each other pretty well because, she
      knows when I'm upset and I know when she's not feeling good too .
    : null
    I, I trained him on my own: null
    I, I tried to have, , figured something having,: null
    I, I w, we bought the movie: null
    I, I wouldn't feel, hesitant about bringing a puppy in,: null
    I, I'd, I really don't know: null
    I, I'll, I hope you'll find him.: null
    I, I'm glad she was able to pull out of it and so cheaply the second time.: null
    I, I'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog,: null
    I, I've dealt with quite a few of them.: null
    I, I've never owned a cat like that.: null
    I, I've, I've got a little kitten, that's still, just being born right now.: null
    I, I, I have friends with hamsters and gerbils: null
    I, I, I typically am not a cat person.: null
    I, I, I'm partial towards the larger dogs.: null
    I, I, we always had a pet when I was growing up, always had a dog.: null
    I, he would have been a great, great dog.: null
    I, in fact my children gave me this, this little puppy for Christmas.: null
    I, it's real contagious: null
    I, met my son's, college roommate, is a vet: null
    I, really wanted that retriever's disposition.: null
    I, sort of weird for me to have had one too: null
    I, took the, the dog to a hospital. The dog hospital there: null
    I, wa, I just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while.: null
    I, we will probably will put some things up. Some posters and stuff up .: null
    I, when I was single: null
    If I through anything away that's any kind of meat or anything,: null
    If you do not pick the trash up, the container,: null
    If you shut that door he goes into hiding.: null
    If, if a child is a little intimidated, she'll jump around and, and yip and bark quite a bit,: null
    In fact, she just turned sixteen years old New Year's Eve.: null
    In fact, we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off.: null
    In the winter time there was no smell at all, no odor at all to it.: null
    Invisible fencing,: null
    It always smells of cedar: null
    It cost me over five hundred dollars.: null
    It got leukemia, feline leukemia: null
    It got out under the fence while we were on vacation,: null
    It is great.: null
    It just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved: null
    It just turned two, I believe.: null
    It took me about two weeks to realize, that was real lonely.: null
    It was a little Spitz, wi, a little white: null
    It was about, three feet long, about three feet long.: null
    It was al, almost always at least one cat, sometimes, like fifteen or twenty. But, always cats in the house.: null
    It was awful.: null
    It was bred out of several different retrievers,: null
    It was gorgeous.: null
    It was her ex boyfriend and, just was not mature enough to keep the dog, didn't realize how much work it was: null
    It was just a nice touch,: null
    It was just gorgeous. just gorgeous.: null
    It was kept only by kings.: null
    It was like we can't take it back: null
    It was like, that could be it.: null
    It was really it was s really a of things that were fresh sprigs,: null
    It was so funny.: null
    It was, he was really a neat pet: null
    It was, it was just really a fight to, get her clean.: null
    It will be.: null
    It will get beer for you out of the fridge,: null
    It'd be it'd been deactivated as far as: null
    It's B I C H O N F R I S E.: null
    It's a mud dog.: null
    It's a sheltie.: null
    It's about six months.: null
    It's about, about six months old,: null
    It's been about two years now.: null
    It's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants.: null
    It's just like, it's, it's just so ironic that this would happen: null
    It's just, it's just a great cat,: null
    It's just, it's like I said, we've had him for two years: null
    It's kind of good training.: null
    It's like all right, whose corners is this one.: null
    It's like this train.: null
    It's like, , wait a minute , .: null
    It's north of Salt Lake City, Utah: null
    It's the, an, from an animal shelter.: null
    It's, it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little, transducers or emitters in your yard: null
    It's, just me and my wife: null
    It's, kind of country.: null
    It's, part Chow and part Shepherd: null
    It, it's a miniature.: null
    Joey, on the other hand is a little different.: null
    Just, stays away or runs: null
    Kids just came from all over to come and see Clyde and visit with him: null
    Knocked that parakeet right out of the air.: null
    Least I hope not .: null
    Liberty is the cat.: null
    Lord knows what happened to him.: null
    Lucky and Spot, that's their names: null
    Massachusetts.: null
    Me and cats don't get along too well, ,: null
    Mine is Gin.: null
    Most the class are pretty small.: null
    My brother had fish when I was a kid: null
    My cats do that it.: null
    My dad's like that,: null
    My folks and I always had a dog and a cat,: null
    My husband is a hunter, fisherman, outdoorsman, Marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog.: null
    My husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us.: null
    My kids, my, my fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed: null
    My mother did not like cats.: null
    My mother has dogs: null
    My mother, she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs, that don't train them: null
    My older boy. He never likes to come home from school.: null
    My pet, was hit by a car New Year's Eve,: null
    My, my little Schnauzer is, is my friend.: null
    My, my mother has one that's,: null
    My, son has a,: null
    Nobody came near it when he was there.: null
    Now we don't actually have a pet right now.: null
    ? Now what happened over here was is that people saw the, the first, which would
      actually have been a Skutzhund which is what Rin Tin Tin was.
    : null
    Now, that seems like a cruel thing to do.: null
    ? One morning, the first thing you do is you get up and you, you, you feed this
      cat some, something and, and you make sure that it can get to its litter box.
    : null
    Only in America is there a dog called a German Shepherd.: null
    Only it wasn't like cats at all.: null
    Other than that he gets scared to death.: null
    Our cat we got from the pound the day bef, the night she was going to be put to sleep.: null
    Our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room,: null
    Our one, our one nursing home in has one.: null
    Our only problem with our Schnauzer, she's an indoor dog ,: null
    Our son, on the other hand, who was about eleven at the time, was, not very interested in pets,: null
    Our, our daughter found her and brought her to us,: null
    Ours are pretty calm.: null
    Ours is, a cockapoo.: null
    Ours is, on the small end,: null
    Ours, ours barks more than, than some, because she spent a lot of time at our friends' house.: null
    People, customers that bring them into the shop and ask me they, fit collars and stuff on them: null
    Permanent .: null
    Precious and Rascal are brother and sister: null
    Precious is a medium hair yellow cat,: null
    Pretty good.: null
    Probably seven or eight years.: null
    Pu, we put some papers on the floor,: null
    Quite a long time, probably five or six years: null
    Randy, we've just about used up our time here,: null
    Rascal is a black and white short hair.: null
    Really good temperament and very playful and affectionate, good personality.: null
    Right at the base of that northern peninsula: null
    Right now I've got two, and three cats,: null
    Right now it, it is.: null
    She doesn't hear very well: null
    She goes out: null
    She has the, the color and the black to, tongue of a Chow,: null
    She is so spoiled.: null
    She jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out.: null
    She just, just waited: null
    She looks like a Gol,: null
    She ran off once,: null
    She really didn't know how to handle herself.: null
    She was fifteen when she died.: null
    She was in the house .: null
    She was okay for a couple of years.: null
    She was the greatest, greatest, went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle.: null
    She would, crawl on me: null
    She'd just get on the first step and lay down.: null
    She'll be sixteen in May.: null
    She's a year and a half old now,: null
    She's about seven or eight years old.: null
    She's definitely ready to get out and run around.: null
    She's got a very nice temperament.: null
    She's had about four or five litters.: null
    She's just a lot of company to us.: null
    She's like fiftyfive pounds.: null
    She's not completely pure.: null
    She's only been around one and, and sometimes two people at the most: null
    She's real s, sweet little dog.: null
    She's the most intelligent dog I've ever seen.: null
    She's, a poodle.: null
    She's, o, she's that, this young: null
    She's, she's a good watch dog: null
    She's, she's real good,: null
    She's, she's the oldest one and, but, very possessive.: null
    She, lost all her activity: null
    Since they've become so popular you get what I call backyard breeders.: null
    Somebody just told me that: null
    Sometimes I wish I had not gotten this one, it's a puppy, because I work: null
    Stripper, he started out being a little orphan,: null
    Tha, they found him the next day in a tree,: null
    ? That German shepherd, the American German Shepherd here was a, a, a such an
      unreliable animal that the American Seeing Eye Institute
    : null
    That dates me quite a bit,: null
    ? That dog is bred out of three European dogs. The Belgian Tervurien, a German
      Skutzhund, and a , I always forget the third one. I can see it.
    : null
    That experience was awful .: null
    That is not breed standard.: null
    That makes me feel so bad.: null
    ? That said anything that is a Skutzhund, a, a Tervurien and, Alsatian Alsatian,
      any inner breeding of that can be called a German shepherd here.
    : null
    That snake used to watch our cat walk around.: null
    That was another funny thing,: null
    That was sort of fun,: null
    That was very funny.: null
    That was, that was really hard.: null
    That works out real well.: null
    That's about it .: null
    That's considered a pretty good program.: null
    That's how I got into, into the switchboard project and all that,: null
    That's my buzzer at the door .: null
    That's the one thing we don't like about him.: null
    That's what he said.: null
    That's what we found.: null
    That's why it really surprises me, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before,: null
    That's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out ,: null
    The backyard, it's really big, too, for him to run in and stuff.: null
    The cat is,: null
    The circuses in Europe used to use them: null
    The older kids had wanted one, though,: null
    The vet called her, a golden mix ,: null
    The whole family was so disappointed .: null
    The, the cat almost died,: null
    The, the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild: null
    Then I didn't notice any improvement till the, after the sixth one.: null
    Then I would do it, everyday or two days so I would clean that pan very, very rarely,: null
    There was about seven kids ranging from about, three years to ten years running around the house all at one time,: null
    There was cartoon in COSMO about a year or two ago: null
    There'd be no way.: null
    There's just, there's this, they just fill this void.: null
    There's like two aluminum plants .: null
    They are very determined critters: null
    They didn't.: null
    They don't look a thing a like,: null
    They get real crazy.: null
    They had a Cockapoo, and, and two Bichons: null
    They had five litters of puppies,: null
    They had, he had gotten it from the pound: null
    They just really do not want other animals on their property.: null
    They knew the sucker when they saw one.: null
    They know I don't like it.: null
    They look totally different,: null
    They own the place: null
    They picked up a lot of bad press lately.: null
    They run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars, I think: null
    They were healthy,: null
    They will recommend their shepherds as a children's dog.: null
    They're always up where they don't, where they're not supposed to be.: null
    They're eleven and eight: null
    They're huge.: null
    They're just huge .: null
    They're okay,: null
    They're really looking for a lot more men to participate.: null
    They're very strict about it.: null
    They're very,: null
    They're, they're real sturdy little critters: null
    They've heard about it: null
    They, get to feeling so lovey and dovey: null
    They, they'll dance: null
    This is a little bigger than a teacup.: null
    This is bred for,: null
    This is quite a, quite a long distance.: null
    This is the very first one I've, I've talked to.: null
    This, this cat is a, more like a dog.: null
    This, this friend of mine has, th,: null
    Tibby and Liberty.: null
    Tibby is the dog: null
    Trying to remember we had a dog for a while,: null
    We call him Neek.: null
    We came from Colorado,: null
    We did that every weekend,: null
    We got her from the, Humane Society when she was a puppy.: null
    We had a cat that had kittens.: null
    We had a little, dog,: null
    We had her for, fifteen years, I think, my family did, and just loved her.: null
    We had just moved into this house and, decided to wait about a year and then went,: null
    We had, the kids had rabbits for pets,: null
    We have a, a dog that we got from the,: null
    We have a, a mutt.: null
    We have grandchildren that run through: null
    We have him on film, on the video camera .: null
    We have some friends with a brother and sister Golden retriever: null
    We have three dogs and: null
    We have two Chows and, , a miniature Schnauzer, and recently added, a guinea pig, , which wasn't by my choice,: null
    We have wooden floors: null
    We have, tortoise which is a black and, and orange.: null
    We just couldn't leave without it.: null
    We kind of like,: null
    We like them around.: null
    We like, we like pets,: null
    We live out here by, it's by Ogden.: null
    We miss him a lot,: null
    We named him, we named him Buddy after, Buddy Bell, the Ranger baseball player that used to be here.: null
    We started out with two, with two outdoor cats: null
    We treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten.: null
    We try to take her out right before we go to sleep,: null
    We used to swap back and forth dogs.: null
    We went through twentytwo hundred dollars worth of vet bills.: null
    We were going to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husband's family had had shepherds: null
    We were talking about that tonight since, he, we just, he just got out yesterday: null
    We're down to a simple dog and cat now,: null
    We're, we're only about ten minutes from Ogden.: null
    We've been to the pound,: null
    We've got so many when he was a puppy ,: null
    We've had him for about two years: null
    We've had him for,: null
    We've had kid, we've had dogs when I was a kid,: null
    We've had those,: null
    We've had two dogs: null
    We've had, in the past, we've had birds, too, like Cockatoos.: null
    ? We've, we thought probably our neighborhood in Houston had more of this breed
      than any other place just because of, the family that had them and, and bred
      them.
    : null
    We, I think they're a lot of company,: null
    We, that's was our cat's name that, that, that died.: null
    We, we had a dog that was a, mix between an Alaska Malamute and a Labrador: null
    We, we tried a dog about four years ago, we ended up with, malamute and some other kind of mix.: null
    We, we used to live in an apartment: null
    We, we've, saw him just about a year ago: null
    We, we, I had one that had, we had, we had to put to sleep he got so sick.: null
    Were it not for my son, the cat would not be in this house .: null
    West Virginia.: null
    When Dan would drum he'd sit there and scrunch up,: null
    Which makes her, I guess, unshowable,: null
    With Domino, she was full grown,: null
    You can walk a dog: null
    You cannot show your retriever if it's, a hundred plus pounds.: null
    You don't know that, .: null
    You had to be sure you left the doors open,: null
    You really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way.: null
    You really, y, you don't know what it's going to until it's all over.: null
    You've got it.: null
    Your two fish.: null
    a dog would be running around crazy .: null
    ? a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to co, the dog catcher
      or somebody to come and get this puppy that,
    : null
    a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog: null
    a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha,: null
    a friend of mine had, an eel,: null
    a friend of mine said, th, she, that she gre,: null
    a lot of kids are scared of that. And I understand because she is, a lot of movement and everything: null
    a lot of people, drop off abandoned, abandoned pets at her house: null
    a lot of times now when you buy them from the S P C A or: null
    a lot of times,: null
    a mill rat had been bought: null
    ? a person lives across the street from me, brought her home from work because
      a coworker of hers, had this dog appear on its front doorstep,
    : null
    a toy poodle, a toy poodle: null
    about a year I guess.: null
    ? about fifteen years ago the German Shepherd Club of America decided amongst
      themselves that they were going to change this.
    : null
    about two years.: null
    actually he had no trouble at all.: null
    actually it was on a sign at Taco Bell drivethru that said free kittens.: null
    actually it's he's the cat person: null
    ? adults, if they're strange to her, or, or they look suspicious or something,
      she acts like she wants to chew their leg off.
    : null
    ? after the two week period was up, she then informed me that the woman no longer
      wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it.
    : null
    after the, the second shot she was significantly better.: null
    again dad went through the whole thing,: null
    again going through that because our, our animals are almost like our kids in some ways,: null
    all four of ours are house cats.: null
    all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house: null
    all of a sudden this bird and I have become wonderful friends.: null
    all of her animals that she ever had were adopted.: null
    all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down.: null
    all the, all three of them, dog, cat and skunk, used to chase each other all through the house.: null
    also, the whole, whole thing with noise.: null
    although I've heard rabbits are pretty good: null
    aluminum plants.: null
    and the people in the lab one day called in my friend and said, this rat is acting really strange I think he's sick,: null
    and when I notice in the winter, when it's worse, it's cold weather and so forth then I have, gotten a booster for her.: null
    another five or six weeks I'll be bringing the little kitten over to, to my folks.: null
    any cat that comes near, and even a dog he won't, he won't jump at them or anything,: null
    any pet that I get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered.: null
    any, more, whenever anybody comes over, we all have to show him Domino .: null
    anything that, that they think is good,: null
    anytime they hear your voice, they come.: null
    anyway he brought this home: null
    anyway she's, she enjoys her though,: null
    anyway, he just, he went and found this guy in, in Dallas somewhere who had picked up one in, I guess in Te, in Mexico,: null
    apparently they've been so in, I don't know inbred, or what,: null
    as I say, we got it from the Humane Society,: null
    as I understand it, both sides of the, were thoroughbreds.: null
    as a matter of fact, I was thinking that same thing, unconditional love.: null
    as if the dogs weren't enough, had to have, a guinea pig,: null
    as it turned out, he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals.: null
    as luck had it, she had puppies the same week my daughter was born,: null
    at first, they seemed to be upset,: null
    at least she can go: null
    at one point I had a snake, skunk, dog and cat running loose in the house.: null
    at the present time I have two dogs.: null
    at the time they were, grade five and, and grade eight,: null
    at this age, I guess so.: null
    attached to that is a, twelve foot leash,: null
    basically it, right now it, it's fully trained: null
    be, before we got her, everybody said, "Oh, they're just like a cat,": null
    because as I said our, our Schnauzer was old.: null
    because my dogs chase them.: null
    because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards: null
    because she's so old, she doesn't have much control: null
    because some people, want to train them as,: null
    before that we had all Dachshunds,: null
    before the dog died, we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side,: null
    being single, she's become very important in my life: null
    both the half breed and the pure breed had the, what I consider the, the, the perfect disposition.: null
    both, Joey and, Stripper get treats .: null
    boy, it was, that was funny too, watching him kind of burned up: null
    bring, bringing them in as puppies they got along just fabulous with her.: null
    by Christmas time we went down to the pound and got him, I I gue, Humane Society and got, got another one, a stray.: null
    by the way, I'm, an R V, full time R V er,: null
    campus housing does not even allow thinking about that .: null
    cats are really almost more territorial than, than dogs are.: null
    cause he has had him for six or seven years.: null
    clamped onto my finger and would not,: null
    course, when he runs around the yard, he just digs,: null
    course, when my children were growing up, we always had a dog, and always said it was because the children wanted the pet: null
    currently we have a poodle.: null
    customer of mine has a parrot,: null
    definitely different .: null
    do you have, you said you had two cats,: null
    does his little jobbies in the litter box,: null
    dogs take a lot of, a lot more care than cats do.: null
    dogs that get down in the hips,: null
    during the day I have her on a, on a leash,: null
    during the day, I me,: null
    especially when he was inside and just eating lettuce, it dried up a little bit like ashes: null
    especially when they're young when they bring them in: null
    even that's, small time mostly.: null
    ? even, police corps which started, finding other breeds to use because this thing,
      this, this thing known as a German shepherd here, its personality and its dependability
      and its reliability was just terrible.
    : null
    every couple weeks, they wou, one would slip away: null
    every night when he comes home from work, he hugs it and talks to him: null
    every time you see one hit on the side of the road you say is that my cat.: null
    everybody wanted Rin Tin Tin.: null
    everybody was used to him: null
    except we live in Plano, Texas now: null
    finally my wife, wife, bless her heart, got rid of it, because I didn't really like it.: null
    finally we made it back to, to Carney: null
    finally, my children are the ones said, "Mom, you've put up with that skunk long enough,": null
    first off we'd probably wind up with a, a cat or maybe a puppy.: null
    fish in a tank.: null
    for a while they built a, a run for him out to the side of the house,: null
    for some reason or other he had a thing for them.: null
    for those dogs that are registered: null
    fortunately it was just like a retriever: null
    fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier.: null
    from fourteen down to seven.: null
    from my neck of the woods, it's hilly.: null
    from that aspect, I'm short on the discipline, because I don't, enforce that the kids look after the dog: null
    from what we can tell it was a pellet gun: null
    gee, she hated baths worse than anything.: null

    it looks like their kneading bread . *spelling "their" should be "they're": null
    it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside.: null
    it needs to be put to sleep: null
    it really didn't dawn on me until Sunday,: null

    it sort of has a bob tail.: null
    it sounds like a train.: null
    it started raining: null
    it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really: null

    it's been an excellent dog,: null
    it's been so much fun too, talk.: null
    it's been, sort of a, a change for my husband because as a, a, a boy growing up, his father had dogs: null
    it's called .: null
    it's freezing: null
    it's funny how, how I, I, a, acquired this animal.: null
    it's grandpa's dog,: null
    it's his bir, the first one that we had was his bird,: null
    it's his cat,: null
    it's in that breed.: null
    it's just an accident .: null
    it's just been tearing me up all day .: null
    it's just hysterical.: null
    it's just one of those concessions,: null
    it's just she wants to get into trouble.: null
    it's just wonderful.: null
    it's just, too much.: null
    it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society .: null
    it's kind of fun.: null
    it's kind of nice: null
    it's like nobody messes with her mamma.: null
    it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out,: null
    it's like your claws need trimming.: null
    it's like, all right who comes first the cat or the baby.: null
    it's made such a difference for her.: null
    it's my first dog I've had: null
    it's my son's cat.: null
    it's my son,: null
    it's nice having a dog here,: null
    it's not a big deal really,: null
    it's not like she's hungry,: null
    it's on Oneida lake: null
    it's on, I think, two or three nights for maybe an hour or two: null
    it's one of those things I'm just having to get used to: null
    it's part, Doberman and part Husky .: null
    it's pretty good training, I think really, keeps her on her toes .: null
    it's really cold and drizzly: null
    it's really going to lead the way, for a lot of econ, applications and, and development in the voice area.: null
    it's really kind of funny.: null
    it's really, it's, it's kind of a show piece: null
    it's so nice to have, come home and find something, or someone who's really so happy to see you.: null
    it's somebody calling for my kids,: null
    it's the Alsatian that's the kid's dog.: null
    it's the first time he's ever been gone like this .: null
    it's the same guy that was watching, my German Shepherd when he got hit,: null
    ? it's the strangest thing, though, children, no matter how strange they are,
      or how new they might be can walk, right up to her,
    : null
    it's unfortunate,: null
    it's very strange: null
    it's, Mitzi.: null
    it's, it's just hysterical.: null
    it's, it's not that big that,: null
    it's, it's such a pleasure to come home at night: null
    it's, it's, teacup: null
    it's, miniature.: null
    it's, we just moved recently: null
    it's, whoever had it before must have trained it real well, because it's just, it's, a good house dog.: null
    it, definitely responds to, to authority: null
    it, it bit him.: null
    it, it burned up one time: null
    it, it was a long time before I could really pet him: null
    it, it's a Spanish Pointer named Domino.: null
    it, it's actually my wife's dog, I, I became part owner six months ago when we got married,: null
    it, it, it's ju, just not feasible: null
    it, that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing,: null
    it, the bird got away from him one afternoon,: null
    just finished up my fourth semester.: null
    just goes everywhere with him.: null
    just regular water.: null
    just the smell is so bad ,: null
    just, he was so cute,: null
    just, it's kind of a shame that I'm, I'm go, I'm away from it now.: null
    just, when he'd pet him, he'd just stretch: null
    kind of like big do, big dogs: null
    knowing how they love to dig: null
    last time I was there was fall so probably wasn't that bad .: null
    last year I had ano, I had another German Shepherd,: null
    let's see, winter before last we would bring her in, and, when it was cold.: null
    little kids can just, maul all over her,: null
    lots of times he, it, he seems to get in fights,: null
    luckily enough, we found the cat in time and, rushed him to the vet: null
    managed to get him to a veterinarian in time,: null
    many times my wife would be lying there on the sofa,: null
    maybe three hundred, four hundred feet elevation,: null
    mine had been a, a, a: null
    mom gets to take care of it, or something.: null
    most of the agriculture, it's more in the way of, sheep and cattle.: null
    most of the time when we have problems with restroom is in the night,: null
    my best friend in Virginia's daughter, is a part of this project in Texas.: null

    my daughters both have hamsters.: null
    my dog thinks he's a mother turtle,: null
    my family didn't necessarily like, like them as much as I did,: null
    my house was loaded with fleas,: null
    my husband and I are in such a situation that, I'm kind of, not able to do a lot,: null
    my husband calls her street dog,: null
    my husband does.: null
    ? my husband had been ma, in fact, he's been, probably has made a few more calls
      than I have because I tend to not make them around dinner time,
    : null
    my husband had one when he was growing up.: null
    my husband had originally wanted an: null

    my kids would love a pet.: null
    my mother who's very elderly lives with us,: null
    my my dog, last German Shepherd, it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too.: null
    my neighbor said to me, I noticed those dogs, dogs are so well trained,: null
    my parents' house is like three miles south of where the MasonDixon Line would have hit the Ohio River had it: null
    my son Dan went to, to, Hawaii for the summer: null

    my son left, went to school,: null
    my son needed some money,: null
    my son was just dying for a bird,: null

    my wife and I have a dog that soon be eight years old,: null
    my wife got them from, friend of hers at work and everything, as kittens,: null
    my wife was working: null
    my, I got my mom a teacup ,: null
    my, both of them are either in or out of college,: null
    my, my daughter was living at home then,: null
    my, my dog when I came home, when I come home in the evenings, my dog greets me at the door.: null
    my, my doggie, that we have now, she's, she's mostly Golden Retriever.: null
    my, my first one that I got,: null
    my, my husband's always wanted a Chow: null
    my, my kids,: null
    my, my personal preference is, is a dog.: null
    n, Newhart is the, the,: null
    name was Clyde.: null
    naturally these are cats,: null
    next morning, she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom.: null
    nobody's home.: null
    none, none right now.: null
    normally, he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet,: null
    not many people in this part of the country know anything about .: null
    not mutts, but mixes: null
    not one mess does she make: null
    not really.: null
    now I think there are tests that can be conducted, to tell whether or not the puppies have the, have it.: null
    now he bites her.: null
    now he wants a, a good size dog .: null
    now it's funny.: null
    now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town.: null
    now it's like, if he doesn't come home, can we get another dog .: null
    now they have this, you get these liners,: null
    now we have a kid: null
    now we have two parakeets.: null
    now we're in the, Dallas area: null
    now, I think he barely makes it.: null
    now, I've got another one,: null
    ? now, in order to, to accommodate the motion detectors we have to keep her, locked
      up in the, the master bedroom during the day
    : null
    nowadays you, you'll get, you'll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific, breeder handler.: null
    of course the dog is not trained for anything yet,: null
    of course, I had to take him.: null
    on huge doses of antibiotics,: null
    on next night, I spread the newspaper in the bathroom: null
    once she did it, then she would, she wouldn't,: null
    once she's gone, I'm not sure if I'll get another animal or not .: null
    one day I was talking to a lady about gardening: null
    one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling .: null
    one night we'd forgotten to put water out for him: null
    one of his fish jumped out of the, fish tank. And fried itself, , on the radiator behind the dresser.: null
    one of my fifth graders last year came up to me and said, my mom's making me get rid of the bird,: null
    one of the fish was missing: null
    one of the people, that we went with, they were friends of ours,: null
    one of them is a lot bigger than the other one: null
    one of them ran off.: null
    one year I forgot to get him his leukemia booster: null
    ? one year down in Florida on a vacation, for Father's Day, my kids, years ago,
      maybe, ten years ago, go, bought me a skunk from a exotic pet shop.
    : null
    one's a seal point,: null
    one's real nice,: null
    other than that it was inside when it wanted to be, it was outside when .: null
    otherwise, he can jump, just as long as he doesn't bend a certain way.: null
    our Chows, we've had them, I'd say, right around six maybe seven years: null
    our cat would sleep with us: null
    our cats never went outside,: null
    our cats wound up getting fleas, from the apartment that we were in: null
    our dog, Joey, has, a back problem.: null
    our friends in Houston bred the dogs.: null
    ? our guide that day said that the la , one woman many, many years ago had given
      a huge sum of money to, to the university, on the condition that there be, dogs
      just kind of left to roam aro, around the campus.
    : null
    our house when I, when I was growing up there was almost never, at least one cat in the house.: null
    our last, we've, we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus.: null
    our male cats, we had,: null
    ? our miniature Schnauzer, she's just, she's just a little hyper thing and just
      prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly,
    : null
    our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them.: null

    she's, she's grown up with them and loves them to death: null
    she's, she's picked up a lot of things, just, just by, teaching by force, I guess is what I'd like to say.: null

    she, she turned out to be a great dog: null
    she, she was alm, she was just inundated with, with all the attention.: null
    since I, I didn't want to,: null
    ? since it slept in the castle with its master, it had, it had to be of a disposition
      to make it, an animal you could keep around that closely.
    : null
    since then, I, I live alone,: null
    since they've moved to where they are, they let the cat out.: null
    so far we just: null
    so } it, this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to, tug on it to walk it.: null
    some he destroys: null
    some he keeps.: null
    some lady, she,: null
    some people might not believe that: null
    somebody had bought him,: null
    somebody's trying to cut in on my line: null
    somebody, somebody abandoned her: null
    someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school,: null
    someplace where there,: null
    sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him.: null
    sometimes it doesn't work .: null
    speaking of pets, I'll tell you, my, my kids are older now,: null
    starting up an aqu, an aquarium,: null
    that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap.: null
    that did, did more responsibility. When its yours and not your brother's .: null
    that helps, too, if they can keep,: null
    that kind of calms him down for the most part.: null
    that made me think of, when our daughter was looking at colleges, we visited a campus in, Saint Louis: null
    that made me very proud .: null
    that night we had a reception for some of the, potential high school students or college students,: null
    that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall,: null
    that was a bad one.: null
    that was a traumatic experience for us too.: null
    that was even harder for,: null
    that was fun,: null
    that was interesting.: null
    that was neat,: null
    that was something we were looking for,: null
    that was the thing I couldn't figure out: null
    that was, that was the only time she wanted to get wet: null
    that's a male.: null
    that's all there is to it.: null
    that's because they have a Great Dane .: null
    that's been years ago.: null
    that's how Cleo, w,: null
    that's how we got her,: null
    that's it, .: null
    that's mainly people that have never had pets around their children,: null
    that's mostly why we got it. To keep her company while I am away at work.: null
    that's not too far from were we live,: null
    that's one of the requirements I asked him.: null
    that's the boys.: null
    that's the breed standard for females.: null
    that's the white dog with the feathers: null
    that's what ours is .: null
    that's what we had intended to get in Houston,: null
    that's what we'd rather have is just a pet, instead of: null
    that's when we lived in Oklahoma,: null
    that's where I live,: null
    that's where I live, too.: null
    that's why I laughed when they called with the topic.: null
    that's why we've never gotten a female, in anything.: null
    that's, that's what matters.: null
    that's, that's what ours are too.: null
    that, that was my first real experience with, with a puppy: null
    the German Shepherd that I had before,: null
    the Manx, is that the one that doesn't have a tail: null
    the Schnauzer I'm, I'm watching for one of, the managers where I work: null
    the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years .: null
    the bad thing was, though, she would pee in my husband's shoes.: null
    the biggest chunk of what's going on there is, is, industry.: null
    the birds, you, it's hard to keep them from squawking or whatever: null
    the cat died.: null
    the cat got sick.: null
    the cat would be on the back of the sofa,: null
    the cat would sleep on my husband's side, .: null
    the cat's just looking at me like, sorry.: null
    the cats are, they might be as old.: null
    the cats do it in there,: null
    the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom: null
    ? the doctor called me up and said, she had a low white cell count and that, she
      wasn't, she was dying and, suggested that I take her to a working hos, dog hospital,
      animal hospital .
    : null
    the doctor had called her up and said, your cat died: null
    the dog is probably about, about thirteen, fourteen years old.: null
    ? the dog kind of, kind of felt out of place then because she was, she was being
      fed, and everything else from all directions.
    : null
    the dog messes all over the carpet: null
    the dog rode in the car: null
    the dog was being house sit, or dog sit, whatever, by some friends of mine down the street,: null
    the dogs are mainly mine and my husb,: null
    the female's red: null
    the first one I got.: null
    the first time I brought her home, she was only, was it six weeks old.: null
    the first weekend we had him we had, we were in a apartment, in a two bedroom apartment,: null
    the friends, other friends of mine have cats,: null
    the kids couldn't handle him: null
    the kids just fell in love with it.: null
    the larger they are, the more room they need to exercise.: null
    the last thing he chewed up was, when we ...: null
    ? the last thing he did was, when I had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the
      backyard, and he dug them all up and brought them to the porch.
    : null
    the male is black.: null
    the mud dog.: null
    the neighbors used to let their dogs out,: null
    the next morning you want to take them out,: null
    ? the next morning, when my roommate got up and, and, did not feed it right away,
      it decided that, that it was going to protest.
    : null
    the next year our, our son Ken went to Hawaii: null
    the one male that she used had a tooth problem: null
    the one that we had just didn't want any part of that.: null
    the ones that are shown, they are inside that weight allowance.: null
    the ones that have dogs are very, protective of them: null
    the only Chow he's got is, is his tongue.: null
    the only pet that I've had,: null
    the only thing that they could come up with was a Bichon Frize which is a,: null

    the other one is a,: null
    the other one is named Holly.: null
    the other one, the first one I got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there.: null
    the other two cats I have are outdoor cats.: null
    the other two cats will follow in pursuit.: null
    the people that he got the from, used to have cats: null
    the problem that we're having with our puppy right now he's not: null
    the puppy jumped in the, into some of the pools but not into the,: null
    the second time he never came back.: null
    the skunk was a good, a decent pet,: null
    the skunk would be sitting at her feet,: null
    the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there: null
    the third one is a children's dog.: null
    the two that were outside, they're like brothers,: null
    the vet had told us they get strange,: null
    the vet said it runs rampant in this area ,: null
    the way my mom's presence countenance is, just, just for having a puppy: null
    the whole big sad story.: null
    the whole time I was pregnant they kept saying, are you getting rid of your cats,: null
    the woman needed someone to babysit: null
    the worst part that I had with him,: null
    the yard's all fenced in: null
    ? the, the problem is if, if the, if someone would have came up to me and said
      it's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive.
    : null
    the, the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it .: null
    the, the, the vet sent me a bill for what he did: null
    their cat was not a friendly cat,: null
    their cats, they're so used to the attention, that if they don't get it, they get really upset,: null
    their eyesight, they can't see very far either.: null
    then I would just have messes in the house,: null
    then she crawls on the carpet: null
    then she recouped.: null
    then the cat, died.: null
    then the, the animal's in trouble, and not the person.: null
    then when I went out in the world, I couldn't take her with me.: null
    then } we got this new cat,: null

      translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you.
    : null
    they bred it for companionship and, disposition and, and ability to hunt.: null
    they came from the same litter and everything.: null
    they couldn't figure out what had happened: null

    what happened is, is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect.: null
    what they, what they do is, is they say, it's going to cost, twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this: null
    what was funny was that, our daughter must have been,: null
    what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly,: null
    what we used to do was just put, newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter: null
    what you see shown and bred now as Golden Retrievers, this, plus eighty to a hundred pound range.: null
    when Beauregard was talking he was the dog, remember.: null

    when that beagle passed away, he didn't want, he wasn't going to have another dog,: null
    when the guy came over, he was infatuated by that skunk,: null
    when we didn't it was, like, no, .: null
    when we first moved here, when the dogs and I didn't fe,: null

      any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us.

    when you start doing that you really tamper with, the, all the, the years of, culling litters: null
    when you touch him a certain way on the back,: null
    when, when Dan went up to college up at , Idaho he took him with him,: null
    when, when we had our family dog growing up I was eleven or twelve, I think, when we first got him,: null
    while Dan was in Hawaii, Ken decided he wanted a dog: null
    while he showers, it's so hilarious.: null
    why, I don't know,: null
    wife and I, we have, we have two cats.: null
    with our children,: null
    wouldn't have,: null
    you ca, you have to be pretty tender with them,: null
    you can see her smiling from ear to ear, she's so happy to see me.: null
    you can't get a Golden Retriever near water without it jumping in.: null
    you can't help but love her.: null
    you can't put that on the ,: null
    you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat: null
    you can't, you could never call her and she would come to you,: null
    you come home your, your pet's there for you and s, wants a little food a little attention.: null
    you could just vacuum it up.: null
    you could see him just enjoying it like a cat does.: null
    you couldn't do anything.: null
    you feed them: null
    you get so attached to them.: null
    you go crazy thinking it might be yours.: null
    you grieve just as much over them when they go: null
    you had to go chase her down.: null
    you know I visualize that animal racing about,: null
    you pull it and take it out and throw it away,: null

  Statement-opinion: !!set
    Animals have a way of talking .: null
    Especially with the kids.: null
    Everybody seems to be really happy with them.: null
    For cats anyway,: null
    Get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids .: null
    Golly the Golden Retrievers are good dogs too,: null
    He'd probably look pretty funny if we did that.: null
    I can't seem to communicate with a cat like I can with my dog.: null
    I don't know that a cat would do that, .: null
    I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big.: null
    I don't think it's anything we did .: null
    I don't think they're always necessary.: null
    I don't, I don't know because the cats pretty much,: null
    I don't, we couldn't do that with a dog.: null
    I enjoyed talking about pets with you.: null
    I guess every one, one one, one of them, every once in a while, you get one that's not so intelligent: null
    I guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid, right? .: null
    I guess it's because you lived with, him: null
    I guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal.: null
    I guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house,: null
    I guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough .: null
    I guess, in one sense we felt that, it, it's nice to have a dog even though there are, complications come with it.: null
    I must say it was interesting.: null
    I never heard of that before.: null
    I suppose it was still in the instinct of them to: null
    I suppose our five minutes will be up.: null
    I think it does, it, it,: null
    I think it really helps them to understand when, when they go to other people's houses: null
    I think it was probably a, an individual ferret thing, because it was f, it was a fairly wild ferret.: null
    I think it's good for kids to grow up around pets,: null
    ? I think it's really important to that, that if you get a pet that they're spayed
      neutered so that, we're not just going on with this pet population and having
      to,
    : null
    I think maybe we have,: null
    I think our community is a lot more conscious now though too,: null
    I think that if somebody else picks him up,: null
    I think that's all I have to say.: null
    ? I think that's one of the, the issues people need to think about before they
      get a dog is, do you have the room for this dog to run around,
    : null
    I think that's one reason they have them, especially older people that I know, that have pets.: null
    I think that's true,: null
    I think the reality of it is, that they perhaps,: null
    I think there was one in the school, zoology department,: null
    I think they enjoy that.: null
    I think they have a good head on their shoulders.: null
    I think they have a, a higher level of intelligence than other, dogs that I have encountered.: null
    I think they would socialize easier.: null
    I think they're actually supposed to,: null
    I think you have to have time,: null
    I think, I guess so.: null
    I think, I think a lot of that, that, that we hear all the time is how you bring them up.: null
    I think, I think it's a good idea to have them.: null
    I thought that was most unique.: null
    I'm glad we have two of them, otherwise, I think they get neurotic if there just one of them.: null
    I'm sure that,: null
    I, I don't take too well to, to those: null
    I, I find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs.: null
    I, I think animals are really important in the family.: null
    I, I think it will: null
    I, I think they're kind of nice to have,: null
    I, I wouldn't picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat.: null
    I, I, I think that,: null
    If you put enough patience into,: null
    It seems to mellow them or something.: null
    It sounds beautiful,: null
    It was a beautiful animal,: null
    It was fairly reasonable, too.: null
    It was kind of interesting.: null
    It was, uncanny .: null
    It's a different little things, t,: null
    It's funny how, how pets can kind of, take on a certain status in certain areas.: null
    It's hard to do that when you're not there constantly,: null
    It's just so neat.: null
    ? It's nice and small, which means, if you don't get the class this semester,
      then you've got to wait or three or four s, anywhere from two to four semesters
      to get,
    : null
    It's not as much fun.: null
    It's too bad it happened, though.: null
    It's wonderful.: null
    On the other hand, you sure, they sure created a, a wonderful breed,: null
    Or the smell or something.: null
    Otherwise they're pretty smelly .: null
    People are crazy.: null
    Rather than just little fish.: null
    Same idea .: null
    Schnauzers, in particular probably.: null
    She must have known he didn't like her or something.: null
    Sheltie Collies are, timid,: null
    Some of them are really beautiful, too.: null
    That kind of builds some: null
    That will help.: null
    That would be fun if you could get them trained.: null
    That'd be the best way to be.: null
    That's good.: null
    That's not too bad.: null
    That's one thing about cats though,: null
    That's probably a good idea.: null
    That's what are so neat about animals,: null
    That's, that's kind of great.: null
    That, that is really probably bad timing.: null
    That, that kind of gripes on me some,: null
    The cats are so independent: null
    The thing I don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek,: null
    The, the saltwater fish have so much more color: null
    They actually, sort of take over the place: null
    They aren't the best pets.: null
    They can be nippy.: null
    They don't care what you look like,: null
    They don't tend to get real jealous or territorial.: null
    They just are fascinated.: null
    They just give it,: null
    They just love you, unconditionally.: null
    They like to play.: null
    They like to roam and investigate.: null
    They look like an air headed let me tell you.: null
    They love to play with kids.: null
    They put up with a lot.: null
    They say ruined them .: null
    They say that's not the way to do it now.: null
    They usually are after something like that happens to them.: null
    They're a good temperament: null
    They're always, right there, and like, like you to pet them and loving.: null
    They're calm, they're not , they're trainable, they're, very personable in a different way that a Golden Retriever is.: null
    They're cute.: null
    They're good temperament.: null
    They're good though.: null
    They're not dignified like a retriever can be.: null
    They're very much: null
    This is nothing like cats.: null
    We, we're kind of in a, not a real busy neighborhood, but more so than I'd want him to be out too much: null
    Which I think is a good thing.: null
    Whoever it is will call back.: null
    You can, you can tell them anything: null
    You don't often find that,: null
    You get so attached to them.: null
    You know, those make the best animals, pe, best pets.: null
    You most likely will.: null
    You wouldn't want him to carry her off or something.: null
    You're just supposed to: null
    You, they, they own you: null
    a cat will do the same trick .: null
    a dog you can tell, stop barking, or whatever.: null
    a lot louder than a dog,: null
    absolutely nuts.: null
    after you had an animal for a couple of weeks, it's, you become: null
    again it gets into much fun, , what, I guess they can be.: null
    all cats are indoor cats,: null
    also some poodles,: null
    any, any, any pet's going to, can, can be bad if you train it to be that way.: null
    as long as he doesn't get too aggressive. I guess with the daughter he's all right.: null
    at least you know you did your part.: null
    because most campuses don't allow pets,: null
    cats are good all the time.: null
    dear, it was just awful.: null
    dogs are real high maintenances,: null
    dogs seem to be always in the mood.: null
    everybody always says no more .: null
    he goes out people,: null
    he seems to know the boundaries.: null
    he was trying to hi, ,: null
    he's, cats are usually so independent: null
    he, he seems to have picked it up pretty well.: null
    i, it's like, it's like a kid.: null
    i, it's worth it once you get it.: null
    i, it's, it was interesting.: null
    if they were local people, they would have been able to find him.: null
    if they're not accustomed to something, they, they're really scared.: null
    if you get them young and everything before they go, kind of nuts,: null
    if you're, if you're going to have a pet,: null
    in your, the luck of keeping them alive,: null
    it depends on the,: null
    it doesn't do anything.: null
    it gets, it gets frustrating when you take it outside: null
    it just, kind of goes along with what you were saying,: null
    it just, was almost cruel: null
    it kind of made it seem more homey too .: null
    it really was.: null
    it seems the smaller the are, the, the worse off they are .: null
    it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure.: null
    it was a real positive thing,: null
    it was more fun than you would think. starting from the beginning: null
    it's a matter of exposure really.: null
    it's amazing how much character,: null
    it's funny how pets get to be so,: null
    it's kind of pleasant.: null
    it's like the end of the world.: null
    it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly,: null
    it's not fair to a pet to have a pet here,: null
    it's not quite the same thing.: null
    it's not that big of a problem.: null
    it's not that long ago.: null
    it's so funny to get more than one cat together, because it brings out their personalities.: null
    it's very expensive.: null
    it's, it's a pain to clean: null
    it's, it's just nice that cats, cats, you don't have to let them outside,: null
    it's, that's one of the biggest concerns.: null
    it's, they're just, aggressive by nature: null
    it, I think it calmed her down a little bit,: null
    it, it, it'll, it'll catch on pretty soon, I'll, I'll bet you.: null
    it, it, it's a pretty good class,: null
    ? just seeing the cats, the, the miracle of birth, is tha, that's a, that's a
      neat thing to, to experience as a kid and understand,
    : null
    just, just, put them outside, I guess. Unless you ca, catch them in the act.: null
    kids just loved him.: null
    maybe I'll get you next time.: null
    maybe you nee, you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes.: null
    most dogs do that.: null
    most of them really aren't that pretty,: null
    not critical at all.: null
    now we really get sick .: null
    of course, it, he doesn't know it.: null
    on the other hand you don't want to, you'd be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road,: null
    once you get them going, it's not good to , to deal with, but, they, I, I really like them. *two utts?: null
    people drop things like that off,: null
    rabbits are darling.: null
    real nice dog,: null
    s, I guess you can't really say for cats.: null
    shelties are nice.: null
    some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there.: null
    some people seem fairly well suited for: null
    something giving you some affection as well.: null
    takes a lot of time.: null
    that and also just, getting hit, I guess, or getting beat up.: null
    that is not as good,: null
    that often happens that way.: null
    that sounds like kids.: null
    that that was right.: null
    that the other extreme,: null
    that was just mind boggling.: null
    that was the biggest problem I saw,: null
    that was, that was not a good thing,: null
    that whole space issue, I think, is real important.: null
    that would be a problem .: null
    that would make you really,: null
    that's a nice, nice story.: null
    that's all part of y, of keeping your part of the relationship.: null
    that's good that you're going to get another one.: null
    that's good too.: null
    that's interesting because we have a simi,: null
    that's interesting.: null
    that's it .: null
    that's just like kids,: null
    that's natural: null
    that's okay for weekend: null
    that's really kind of something: null
    that's something that's important for sure.: null
    that's the way it should be,: null
    that's to be expected at,: null
    that's, definite security involved in, in a dog like that.: null
    that's, that's one real drawback,: null
    that's, that's, maybe that's, there's, some credence in that statement.: null
    that, people could go in there.: null
    that, that's incredible.: null
    that, that, that, that will make their day.: null
    the Schnauzers are a little aggressive.: null

    the, they're bred down so much.: null
    there are some smart ones out there,: null
    there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal,: null
    there's some also some, not so smart ones .: null
    they are, like I said, they're, they're really companions,: null
    they ca, they can't do anything,: null
    they can get hurt a lot easier,: null
    they can get hurt a lot easier.: null
    they do dig up: null

    they don't talk back to you .: null
    they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats' .: null

    they just, come up,: null
    they just, they just love kittens.: null
    they just, they just wreck things: null

    they really, yo, you really do mourn them after, when things happen.: null
    they say it's real important for children to have pets because, they can go and talk to them any time,: null
    they seem to be, listen better or something.: null
    they should expect something like that to happen.: null

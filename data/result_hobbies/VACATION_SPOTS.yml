    You always learn something.: null
    You can go,: null

    You park your car,: null
    You put your clothes in your room,: null

    You, you can be as busy as you want to be, or as laid back as you want to be.: null
    a couple of them it was, what we did in some of the other cities: null
    a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China: null
    a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings: null
    actually I lived there,: null
    after that it was, it got better,: null
    after the first time it is like anywhere.: null
    after there I went to Hawaii,: null
    and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit,: null
    any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to Los Angeles,: null
    any, any vacation that we go on is usually,: null
    as I said, basically all I've done is go back and forth to parents: null
    ? as far as, maybe, maybe as the summer heat comes along I would sort of like
      going somewhere where it's not so hot. And being able to be outside, enjoy outside
      activities,
    : null
    as of you can't even ski there anymore.: null
    basically it, it sorts out into that,: null
    be our first chance in awhile,: null
    because we had to take our dog in the car, there was no room for luggage.: null
    ? because we moved to Texas about two years ago. So when we go back we are just
      jam packed full of people to see and things to do
    : null
    because you could go sixtyfive miles an hour on the,: null
    both coasts are really pretty: null
    camping is not near as much fun.: null
    course, there is a lot of places in the United States I still want to come, go to.: null
    enough, enough to make it.: null
    every time, my mother had,: null
    everyday they drive on the ferry.: null
    everyone in Switzerland,: null
    from Kenosha, it's about three hours.: null
    go across the border and all.: null
    go to museums and,: null
    growing up, we would spend most of our vacations right there in Colorado.: null
    had about three kids then I think,: null
    have not been to Spain.: null
    he didn't like Oahu at all .: null
    he really did.: null
    he would give a little talk about mountain things.: null
    he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found: null
    he'll say, this is my itinerary.: null
    he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time: null
    he's going to be,: null
    he's in his sixties,: null
    he's never met them,: null
    he's retired: null
    he's traveled all over the United States: null
    ? he, would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country
      and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there,

    her husband is the new Director of Admissions at, University of Texas at Dallas.: null
    her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston .: null
    his father is a, a doctor: null
    his mother is a kindergarten teacher,: null
    his, his folks did a lot of traveling across country.: null
    hopefully, we'll get to travel a little bit too.: null
    if it's at the beach, the beach is great.: null
    if you go further down, you will usually find some, but not right in there.: null
    in fact I didn't eat out that much there because I was traveling by myself in a car,: null
    in fact some of the days we froze.: null
    in fact, I just got some reservations.: null
    in fact, one, family that sat at our table every meal was from London,: null
    in fact, we stayed there on our honeymoon,: null
    in some places,: null
    in the middle, in the middle of the Summer.: null
    in the position he's in, they don't care if I go along.: null
    in, in the summer would be more like a two month, two month break.: null
    it depends where he's going whether or not I decide to go along: null
    it doesn't matter who it is: null
    it doesn't, doesn't pay.: null
    it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone.: null
    it ended up falling a, falling through.: null
    it has just worked out really well with this, position he's in.: null
    it is actually about thirty minutes from Salisbury.: null
    it is beautiful.: null
    it is commercialized.: null
    it is like Oahu,: null
    it is my favorite.: null
    it is really nice: null
    it is still beautiful.: null
    it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go.: null
    it loses that newness,: null
    it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there: null
    it ought to just be a ball.: null
    it really depends,: null
    it really is pretty.: null
    it really is,: null
    it seems not, it seems not to have as many there, right there.: null
    it takes a while just to even get to the, what I would call the more picturesque part of the country,: null
    it tore the ligaments in my knee .: null
    it was a four day: null
    it was a really nice,: null
    it was beautiful: null
    it was beautiful.: null
    it was better but not a whole,: null
    it was fun.: null
    it was great.: null

    it was rainy and icky.: null
    it was really cold and, and rainy: null
    it was really oriented toward little kids.: null
    it was their winter: null
    it was twentyseven below.: null
    it was very far away on a bus.: null
    it was wonderful.: null
    it was, it was really, it was interesting.: null
    it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are: null
    it was, just to, have some fellowship with her.: null
    it wasn't a tremendous thing, amount of things to do.: null
    it wasn't real rainy.: null
    it will be at this time of the year: null
    it will take, a day and a half to get there, probably.: null
    it would be: null
    it would have been nice. It would have been a nice vacation.: null
    it wound up only taking us about an extra hour.: null
    it's a bird sanctuary,: null
    it's a fun few days.: null
    it's a good town to just,: null
    it's a good town to wander in.: null
    it's a lot of fun.: null
    it's a pretty neat down to just go and walk around, if you like to walk,: null
    it's a pretty nice place,: null
    it's a real different, land and scenery than there.: null
    it's a real pretty place.: null
    it's a, a huge amusement park: null
    it's a, at the very end,: null
    it's all right there.: null
    it's cold and rainy today.: null
    it's fun to be with my cousins.: null
    it's fun. take along a picnic lunch: null
    it's great.: null
    it's hot down here: null
    it's just a big, big tourist attraction.: null
    it's just kind of tourists.: null
    it's just simply beautiful.: null
    it's kind of shaky.: null
    it's like ten dollars a day or something: null
    it's mostly a, a summer, summer place.: null
    it's not a, it's not a place for tourists,: null
    it's not home.: null
    it's not very expensive,: null
    it's only a couple of hours away.: null
    it's pretty fun.: null
    it's really a nice stay.: null
    it's right down there, on the, right there on the ocean, and down there on the wharf by the piers and all,: null
    it's right there at the very foot of the Rockies.: null
    it's the last set of condominiums there,: null
    it's the western half of an island,: null
    it's up by Green Bay.: null
    it's very pretty driving up north in Wisconsin too.: null
    it's very pretty.: null
    it's, called that because it's at the very end of, a jetty there, which is,: null
    it's, it will be probably the most exciting place I'll ever get to go.: null
    it's, it's a different life style than we are used to.: null
    it's, it's beautiful white sand and very clear blue green water, and a,: null
    it's, it's gorgeous.: null
    it's, it's kind of nice being up here just because it's all a vacation in itself when you get to go.: null
    it's, it's really neat.: null
    it's, it's very nice.: null
    it's, really cool .: null
    it's, there's not a language barrier: null
    it, it is our big dream.: null
    it, it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because I hired a guide all the time,: null
    it, it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you.: null
    it, it's, it's a fairly common vacation place for French people to go: null
    it, that was really, really fabulous: null
    just a little day thing on business.: null
    just see, see the rest of the country.: null
    just so we don't, haven't been able to take really.: null
    just ten months.: null
    just the photos I have of it and gosh, incredible and be so close,: null
    kids are really cheaper, too.: null

    like you, we always try to make it, back home to see the relatives.: null
    live on an island off, off shore from Seattle.: null
    mainly just being with family is it.: null
    maybe fifteen even.: null
    maybe it was about a thousand dollars, maybe a little bit less,: null
    maybe, maybe within a year, we will see how that falls .: null
    most of my vacationing in the U S has been on the West Coast: null
    most of the people I've talk to are from, are from Texas,: null

    my cousin came over while I was there,: null
    my daughter's a temp at Texas Instruments,: null
    my experience in Italy was not my favorite for sure.: null
    my family is, real into camping and four wheeling,: null
    my father was working down in Los Angeles for like, six months or so,: null
    my favorite is the, the indulgent ones, where we go off and, and, see places that have interested me since I was a kid,: null
    my fiancee is a very very good photographer.: null
    my girlfriend has with her sisters: null
    my grandparents have a pool: null

    my husband works in Salt Lake,: null
    my husband's family lives just off of Academy Boulevard at Maize land.: null
    my last vacation was in Connecticut.: null
    my more exciting spots have been,: null
    my most recent trip was last year,: null
    my mother and his mother live up there feeling: null
    my mother had us, do some studying of the, the, area which we going to visit: null
    my next trip is going to be to Texas .: null

    no one knew English in there,: null
    normally when we go on vacation we go home, to Colorado.: null
    north, north of that is another town and, a smaller, on a smaller scale, I guess, than Silverton.: null
    not her, necessarily, other people that have been there have said that it is too commercialized.: null
    not much else we do for vacation really,: null
    not much of,: null
    not that much .: null
    not too much into sports.: null
    now I'm getting about sixty bucks a month, free products: null
    now you can get some really good deals flying over,: null
    of course when that movie OUT OF AFRICA came out .: null
    of course, always when I lived in West Texas, had to annually go down to San Antone just,: null
    of course, we keep picking crummy weather to go out there,: null
    on the cruise ship they had Mickey and Minnie and Chip and Dale and Goofy and Donald Duck,: null
    once a week we drive up into the mountains, usually, usually once a week, once every other week.: null
    once we flew to Colorado to Denver: null

    our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older.: null
    our kids loved it and everything: null
    our son and daughterinlaw just, they got married last January and they won a cruise.: null
    our, our standard excuse for not going someplace like that is, Holly would starve to death if we, we took her: null
    over there, every time we'd go and, and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we'd always have to ask for the check: null
    presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles: null
    probably the one I liked most was Hawaii .: null
    probably, maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only: null
    really at our point of life our children are grown: null
    really did.: null
    really, after awhile it really gets annoying,: null
    second time we went to Munich, Germany and were there a week, and loved Germany.: null
    see as much as: null
    seems like I do a lot in the Midwest lately,: null
    she came to Cameroon: null

    she's only been there once.: null
    she's talking on the project too: null
    she's, working on this project too,: null
    she, also told me that,: null
    she, she had this, book of pictures from it that were really nice, kind of like a travel guide: null
    some people did, on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in: null
    someday I hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there.: null
    somehow we picked the right time and, walked down on the wharf,: null
    someone I know was on a cruise to Alaska.: null
    starting, starting at the end of July, we will have two vacation weeks in October and two vacation weeks in March.: null
    th, there are exceptions made for special occasions like that.: null
    tha, I highly recommend that way to go.: null
    that I was when I was a baby: null
    that is about it for me.: null
    that is right near Piedmont.: null
    that is unusual.: null
    that is where I want to go.: null
    that might be fun.: null
    that should be a lot of fun.: null
    that there were several hundred, people: null
    that turned out to be a really good experience for me.: null
    that was Detroit.: null
    that was a great time, because it's that's such a neat place: null
    that was a really fun, interesting trip.: null

    that was nice.: null
    that was one of the most wonderful vacations I've ever had.: null
    that was our experience: null
    that was pretty interesting.: null
    that will be an interesting turn on vacations for our family.: null
    that will be hard to stay away from.: null
    that would have been nice.: null
    that's Door County .: null
    that's a nice little town actually, Frederick,: null
    that's about it,: null
    that's canoeing.: null
    that's enough for, probably another twenty years.: null
    that's her next goal, she can do it, } is go back to England,: null
    that's it was really different being in a big city,: null
    that's just aboard ship.: null
    that's my biggest gripe about living here.: null
    that's not the tradition for us.: null
    that's one of those things,: null
    that's probably my favorite place when I have to go somewhere on a vacation.: null
    that's real pretty over there too.: null
    that's the best place that I've ever canoed.: null
    that's the only thing that they really do not,: null
    that's what everybody says,: null
    that's where my fam, my inlaws are.: null
    that's where we go home, too.: null
    that's why, that's why England was nice.: null
    that's, that's our typical vacation,: null
    that, that I would like to go,: null
    that, that does absolutely nothing for me.: null
    that, that's what I, that's what I would like to do.: null
    the Aquarium is one of those things that, because everybody,: null
    the Davis Mountains are interesting,: null
    the Inner Harbor and the,: null
    the Pacific Science Museum, the little girl really enjoyed.: null
    the bay is circulating over your head,: null
    the beaches are nice,: null
    the closest thing I did was go to some restored castles and stuff.: null
    the fartherest south I've been on the East Coast is Charlotte.: null
    the first time we went out there was, the day after hurricane Hugo had come through .: null
    the furthest I drove was probably Texas,: null
    the hotel that we stayed in,: null
    the kids could eat with Chip and Dale,: null
    the kids in Los Angeles didn't: null
    the kids were getting older and, and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside.: null
    the kids were old enough to really enjoy it.: null
    the lake goes on forever,: null
    the last was back down to Lubbock to visit parents.: null
    the love that she, has for it now after visiting it.: null
    the minute I said the word, he, he, he's chomping at the bit.: null
    the neighborhood that we live, they are switching to an alternate calendar this year,: null
    the one we got is on the, on the beach side.: null
    the only other place I've ever vacationed, we'd, go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that.: null

    the types of vacations that I usually take,: null
    the vacation spots that I like to go to are places like the Bahamas and Florida.: null
    the, it has got its own kitchen, full size,: null
    the, the particular ro, suite we had gotten was very nice: null
    the, the waves were huge.: null
    then I took a train up from Shanghai to a little, Quingdao I think is the name of it.: null
    then our cruise was actually extended a day,: null
    then that's kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the coast: null
    then we were on the cruise for three days in the Bahamas,: null
    then we weren't too for from the Appalachian Trail,: null
    there are people, literally that everyday, take the ferry, and drive,: null
    there is, there is a lot of Japanese over there.: null

    there was another, another amusement park down there, Busch Gradens,: null
    there was nobody there when we were there, we got, we won a log floating ride like five straight times,: null
    there was one year when my father was, my father's company was starting to do stuff down in Los Angeles,: null
    there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in Germany knew English: null
    there were just two of us.: null
    there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off,: null
    there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area, Marble Falls and all.: null
    there's a lot of places in the states that we haven't even gone.: null
    there's a nice, nice train ride that goes up to the city of Silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining.: null

    they said we could either cancel, reschedule, or take whatever was available.: null
    they speak French: null
    they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide: null
    they took some time off that, they could show us around.: null

      and because we were pulling a little U Haul trailer,
    : null
    went to the Seattle Aquarium.: null
    what it truly is supposed to mean is nine weeks of school, three weeks of vacation,: null
    when I heard my topic today, I thought, okay: null
    when I went out there she was in, Lafayette.: null
    when I, when I heard you were from Virginia I was like, okay, there's somebody different,: null
    when he said, this year, I have a week there on a, a project: null
    when the ship docks, you get to go sightseeing and shopping.: null

      a night.
    : null
    when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground.: null
    ? when we normally go that way, we like to go to California at the same time,
      because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably
    : null
    when we, eventually, when we have kids,: null
    where we were, it certainly was: null
    ? while I was there I visited my aunt and uncle who were, staying for their vacation
      in France in Nantes, which is on the west coast, right across from England.
    : null
    with a daughter, nine, it is just,: null
    with the eastern half that's the Dominican Republic.: null
    you also get in to see things that you might not get into: null
    you always have to go out, fly through, unless you fly from Nairobi, you have to fly through, Europe on your way home.: null
    you can go over there and lay on the beach: null
    you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which I thought I would just hate,: null
    you can take part in the games that they have going on.: null
    you can wander,: null
    you can't, can't ski up there any more.: null
    you don't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that: null
    you drive your car on.: null
    you get a little lightheaded and giddy,: null
    you have a beer,: null
    you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery.: null
    you said, I got somebody down in Texas,: null
    you set your brake.: null
    you slept on the train at night.: null
    you walk down in a dome, a glass dome,: null
    you will need to try to go and,: null
    you're in Texas.: null
    you're in a climate that's kind of humid,: null
    you're kind of roughing it.: null
    you, if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals, you meet different people.: null
    you, there were some places,: null
    yours to Disneyworld sounds a little bit better.: null
    '} I was thinking I might be minor league': null
    '} right now the lottery here,': null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    Austin is neat for, for an occasional visit.: null
    Beautiful country,: null
    Beautiful country.: null
    Because when you: null
    Canada is very nice.: null
    Except our outside , though.: null
    I admit up there, the altitude is kind of interesting,: null
    I don't if you've ever seen a map of Wisconsin: null
    I feel like it would be confining.: null
    I find the outdoors very relaxing and, kind of a change.: null
    I guess all of Italy is not like that.: null
    I guess that's what retirement is all about.: null
    ? I guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free
      time, we'll have the, the means to, pursue our dreams.
    : null
    I hate them because they're hard to jockey around,: null
    I really, I think travel ,: null
    I think if they could get tourists coming to their country, they'd improve the economy considerably.: null
    I think it's a wonderful product.: null
    I think most vacations, seven days is enough for us.: null
    I think seven days is long enough for us.: null
    I think that is what usually people,: null
    I think that's a good trip.: null
    I think the scenery kind of,: null
    I think they really it really pen, penetrates in your memory, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it.: null
    I think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,: null
    I think, the biggest limitation is a lot, just time and money, isn't it.: null
    I think. It's very cold.: null
    I'm sure it was wonderful.: null
    I've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there.: null
    I, I guess I, I would contemplate going on a cruise, all circumstances permitting it.: null
    I, I think it's,: null
    I, I think that's, that's the way to,: null
    If you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest .: null
    If you like wildlife, it's a fabulous vacation.: null
    It is beautiful.: null
    It sounds like we've been to some of the same places.: null
    It was like,: null
    It was really interesting.: null
    It wasn't commercialized.: null
    It's just entirely different world than this .: null
    It's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity, and: null
    It's really nice at,: null
    It's really, really pretty.: null
    It's so expensive over there .: null
    It's so funny.: null
    It's, lot different kind of.: null
    It, it's really nice.: null
    Johnstown and, in s, in that area is just really neat,: null
    Most people don't realize it.: null
    Now Colorado Springs is real accessible to Lake Breckenridge: null
    NuSkin is wonderful.: null
    Of course, you haven't lived until you have been to San Antone, to the,: null
    That and sleeping late .: null
    That helps a lot.: null
    That was wonderful: null
    That would have been best time to go.: null
    That's nice,: null
    That's real pretty.: null
    That's the one thing.: null
    There are a lot of neat, neat places to visit in America,: null
    There's a lot out there to see,: null
    There's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything.: null
    To me why somebody would want to ride around on a boat for a few days is mind boggling.: null
    Very restful.: null
    Walt Disney World, and other places, it's just the wrong time of the year to go.: null
    With, the big one I thought was very commercialized.: null
    Without a doubt.: null
    You don't have as much of the greenery like you have.: null
    You have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy, too,: null
    You might be like I am.: null
    You sound like a girl that has it together.: null
    a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents,: null
    as always, it don, it seems a bit, rushed.: null
    beautiful people.: null
    boy that's a nice, a nice place to visit.: null
    boy, they're gorgeous: null
    camping is fun with kids.: null
    course, you get in any of those tourist traps: null
    diving is something that,: null
    down there, in the lower Rio Grande Valley closer to where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf, that's interesting.: null
    driving for Thanksgiving, that's going to be quite a drive for,: null
    especially for small children,: null
    even, even some little ones do pretty good: null
    everybody is really interesting,: null
    everybody is there to have a good time: null
    if you don't like the night life and the antique shopping, there isn't much there,: null
    if you're working, then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go.: null
    interesting things to: null
    is, is a little scary,: null
    it is great.: null
    it seems when your family is, is different places, a lot of trips involved going to visit .: null
    it was beautiful.: null
    it was kind of sad,: null
    it was quiet and restful, and, and so beautiful.: null
    it was strange,: null
    it was too crowded: null
    it was wonderful.: null
    it would be a lot fun.: null
    it would have been, I think, much more fun to do it in the van,: null
    it would really be fun, I think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver: null
    it's a, it's a little more, difficult planning a vacation,: null
    it's enjoyable, too.: null
    it's kind of nice to, to have that.: null
    it's so darn expensive: null
    it's worth it: null
    it's, it might not be too bad if you want to go skiing somewhere else.: null
    it's, it was really fun.: null
    it's, it's just, it's just a gorgeous country.: null
    it's, it's really neat.: null
    it, it is a beautiful country.: null
    it, it is gorgeous.: null
    it, it is, it is nice,: null
    its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you: null
    main, mainly probably because you want to see everything.: null
    may, maybe now things are calming down again.: null
    my, my idea I guess of the ideal vacation would be to begin with,: null
    once they get a little bigger, not teeny tiny ones,: null
    other, other than that, with, with both my kids being under two, it's real hard: null
    really, for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent.: null
    some of the things are not as, quite as, adaptable.: null
    that can be fun.: null
    that sounds wonderful.: null
    that was a wonderful vacation.: null
    that was nice.: null
    that was pushing it a bit.: null
    that was real nice.: null
    that was the way to travel.: null
    that was, that, that's a nice place.: null
    that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know.: null
    that will be fun, too.: null
    that would be nice.: null
    that would,: null
    that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation, now: null
    that'd be nice.: null
    that's a perfect age: null
    that's a pretty city.: null
    that's fun.: null
    that's quite fun.: null
    that's tough.: null
    that's, that's kind of fun.: null
    that's, that's, that area of the world I think would be great.: null
    that, that makes sense, it really does.: null
    that, that's a fun way to , to, cut costs: null
    that, that's really great.: null
    the mountains,: null
    the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of Texas in the summer: null
    the other two were just lovely.: null
    the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter,: null
    the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening,: null
    there is good and there is bad: null
    they call it the Cape Cod of the,: null
    they're going very nice places,: null
    they're so leisurely over there: null
    they, they, they really are.: null
    things are different there, though.: null
    we're so fast paced here,: null
    we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun,: null
    we've gone fairly inexpensive from, as most cruises go.: null
    when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles.: null
    whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at. It's most enjoyable,: null
    which is kind of fun.: null
    you always have a fun experience: null
    you can do anything.: null
    you could kind of sleep in it sometimes,: null
    you don't want to stay in the very, very, very exclusive,: null
    you feel stupid doing that: null
    you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning.: null
    you have probably a lot of green, and lot of real pretty things.: null
    you have to like crowds,: null
    you have, you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to then.: null
    you just have to go once a year.: null
    you learn a lot of, skills too,: null
    you won't even,: null
    you wonder if they're, it's really worth it to pay, thirtyfive dollars or forty dollars just to get in.: null
    you wouldn't want to do it all the time.: null
    you're more receptive.: null

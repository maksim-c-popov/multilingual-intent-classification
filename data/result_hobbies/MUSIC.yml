    It makes, you can say classy: null
    It may be country,: null
    It starts with an E.: null
    It talks about, race relations and police relations: null
    It was funny,: null
    It was good.: null
    It was in J F K Stadium, if I can remember.: null
    It was kind of like, remember when personal calculators first came out,: null
    It was particularly well,: null
    It was real nice.: null
    It was really nice so ,: null
    It was something easily forgotten.: null
    It was the Plano Repertory Theatre.: null
    It went well,: null
    It's a brass instrument.: null
    It's a husband and wife team that we've known for years: null
    It's a little, it's a little too country for me,: null
    It's a, I, I especially like it as an outlet when the T V goes off,: null
    It's been really kind of interesting.: null
    It's classic: null
    ? It's cute, though, because my children, when they get in the car, and I have,
      the button pushed for that, they always switch it to something else .
    : null
    It's his house seat.: null
    It's just my favorite.: null
    It's like a small, a really small, not a tuba, but I th,: null
    It's like brash metal, which all they do is they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar,: null
    It's mostly just the tunes.: null
    It's not where it's, it hurts your ears to hear it.: null
    It's pretty good,: null
    It's really an excellent, excellent C D.: null
    It's, it's daughter, it's his daughter that,: null
    It's, it's sort of like C N N,: null
    It's, it's, it's sort of constant.: null
    It, it's about twenty of his greatest hits on it.: null
    Jimi Hendrix was the original.: null
    John Nelson.: null
    Just because there's a friend up there,: null
    Just by itself,: null
    Just like V C R's, too .: null
    Just, just ever so often: null
    Lately, with the new music that has come out, some of the really good, music: null
    Like my husband is not musical at all,: null
    Like the Dallas opera here normally does, I guess.: null
    Like the old Hank Williams.: null
    Lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching.: null
    MADAM BUTTERFLY was,: null
    Madonna could start playing folk music: null
    Mi, Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he,: null
    Michael Crawford was in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA on Broadway.: null
    Miles Davis worked with Robbie Shoncar,: null
    Most of them I don't know their names of the song,: null
    Mostly the trumpet music baroque and, ,: null
    My boss listens to that.: null
    My brother doesn't even like that kind of stuff,: null
    My dad is a big blue grass fan,: null
    My father likes, country western music.: null
    My husband and I love to go to the musicals downtown, though.: null
    My husband is,: null
    My husband likes Sandy Patty songs.: null
    My inlaws listen to the kind of music I hate .: null
    My mom likes Doris Day,: null
    My mother had: null
    My parents were very musical.: null
    My son is, twentyeight,: null
    My sons are kind of into Broadway.: null
    My tastes now run I guess to a upbeat, Simon,: null
    My, my little boy has gotten so into it that: null
    No more for me.: null
    Not really,: null
    Not, not, the bouncy,: null
    Now I do like folk song.: null
    Now I, I will turn on,: null
    Of course that's what I played,: null
    Of course, Garth Brooks lives about,: null
    On fact, my, my grandmother does that a lot,: null
    One is thirteen and one is eleven.: null
    One of them, turned into a violist,: null
    ? One of things I especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is,
      are those that call on those classical, roots, I guess, Barry Manilow comes
      to mind for some reason there's, there's not a whole lot of his stuff that I'm
      real crazy about,
    : null
    One plays the cello: null
    Only for about three months.: null
    Paul Simon.: null
    Queen was real popular when I was growing up.: null
    Reba McIntire is a little too country for me.: null
    Rick, Bogarts played: null
    Right now I'm busy chasing my kids.: null
    She always had those, these old Doris Day records and stuff like that, though.: null
    She bought that the same night we bought the Nat King Cole and the Garth Brooks.: null
    She does have to really work at it,: null
    She likes it.: null
    She played the clarinet: null
    She said, I like the original version better.: null
    She's not rock: null
    She, she did ,: null
    So I listen to the radio,: null
    Som, sometimes I do.: null
    Some of it kind of falls in the rap category I guess,: null
    Someone at work is trying to get me to join that one, because they need clarinet players: null
    Someone else noticed it: null
    Something happening to me at Christmas time that, that verified to me that I will al,: null
    Sometimes I'll turn on the classical music,: null
    Th, THIS LOVE CUTS LIKE A KNIFE.: null
    Tha, that's just what, just what you had,: null
    That can help people like me.: null
    That is excellent.: null
    That's amazing because: null
    That's certainly where her roots are.: null
    That's exactly me.: null
    That's kind of the way I am.: null
    That's like me.: null
    That's their signal.: null
    That's under his control,: null
    That's, that's what some people call really heavy metal.: null
    That, that doesn't appeal to, my ears.: null
    The Christ United Methodist Church in Plano .: null
    The acid rock or the heavy metal.: null
    The disco years, that's what they're calling them,: null
    The, the best of every type of music.: null
    The, the kind of country I like is kind of the older country music.: null
    Then there is a trumpet player at North Texas, the, the teacher, the main teacher.: null
    There are certain kinds I like and certain kinds I don't.: null
    There's, one particular, there several stations in this area that play, classical music all the time,: null
    There's, some of the really totally country stuff, I don't really particularly like: null
    There, there's a guy,: null
    They are mostly, mostly Mozart.: null
    They can hear the unconscious music signal behind it,: null
    They go to conductors,: null
    They had summonsed eight hundred people,: null
    They have been touring,: null
    They have choir that they go to, music: null
    They have the same kind of station down here,: null
    They keep on dying: null
    They said the music's great,: null
    They're not going to recruit me anymore,: null
    They're still: null
    They're still together.: null
    They, they, my, my older son is at Columbia in New York City,: null
    This guy had supposedly, strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose .: null
    Though I, I couldn't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says, This is Bach,: null
    Twentyeight.: null
    Uh, you know, whatever: null
    Um, well, I could play, uh, the wood chuck song.: null
    Usually in the fifties.: null
    We all go back to parents' houses on the weekends, and what not: null
    We all went to high school together: null
    We are, we were really quite pleased with it.: null
    We didn't have any bass clarinet players: null
    We generally have a concert every other week: null
    We have about four concerts per year indoors: null
    We have, couple of hundred kids in the band,: null
    We listen to ninetyseven point nine: null
    We live in a fairly small town,: null
    We stayed till about one thirty: null
    We were in Colorado recently: null
    We'll start listening to children's music .: null
    We're going to go to Commerce and see a friend.: null
    We're in Sherman.: null
    We're kind of, I was kind of in the middle of supper,: null
    We're on our way.: null
    We're real close to Dallas.: null
    We're talking about what they, what they call hard rock.: null
    We're, we're going to one here in a couple of weeks.: null
    We've been sort of opera fans for a few years now.: null
    We've talked our five minutes though.: null
    Well, I listen to like ninetyseven point one, you know, more,: null
    Well, course, see, I listen to K V I L for the contests.: null
    When he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the scale, the music scale.: null
    Which was real nice.: null
    Willie Nelson.: null
    Yeah, so am I.: null
    You can't drive a car without bumper sticker: null
    You have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt: null
    You hear a, you hear a Paula Abdul song: null
    You just turn there,: null
    You listen to the music and then learn to play it by lear, by hearing the intervals and things like that.: null
    You might have to audition,: null
    You're older than I am .: null
    a C D is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was, too,: null
    a good example would be,: null
    a good, another good example was I heard Miles Davis,: null
    a little bit.: null
    a lot of people they go, they're better than the Beatles,: null
    ? a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now, and from West Africa,
      that's considered world music, because it's not particularly using certain types
      of folk styles.
    : null
    ? a lot of the, a lot of where they, where they make music that they adapt to
      a, to another kind of, to another type of listener.
    : null
    a lot of the, lot of the songs have some lyrics that,: null
    a lot of the, music I don't know about, as far as the titles,: null
    about everything.: null
    about four hundred showed up,: null
    about the only new music I hear is somebody else that I know: null
    actually I just went to see the Greatful Dead about, I guess about a week ago.: null
    actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord.: null
    actually, I did,: null
    actually, I used to play in the Richardson Symphony,: null
    ? all I have to do is hear that song and I get strongly evoked memories of, of
      difficult times in school being behind on work,
    : null
    all my brothers and sisters listen to them, even the ones that like the heavy metal: null
    all these rocks, rock stations call it classic soft rock, .: null
    ? although this was a computer company, he had his, P H D in musical, I guess
      it was in composition, from University of North Texas,
    : null
    an artist is there: null
    and I played it for maybe three months .: null
    and I sing in the choir today: null
    and I still enjoy the marching band: null
    and I still enjoy, uh, singing in the choir: null
    and I've, I still play the piano as of today.: null
    and for three months .: null
    and that's about when I quit.: null
    and that's his station, so I call it the jeezer music.: null
    and they wouldn't let me in.: null
    and we got pretty bored quick .: null
    and you know they're going to call you up.: null
    any time I got bored .: null
    arrangement to,: null
    as I look back now I realize it was very formative for me,: null
    as far as country music is, I've never really, listened to it.: null
    as far as instruments, I can go from piano to the saxophone.: null
    as far as opera goes, I'm, I think most fond of Verdi.: null
    as far as the rap goes, I think there are a few artists that appeal to me: null
    ? as soon as you go down to Salisbury, this town that's, two and a half hours
      away in the suburbs or whatever, in a real rural Balt, Maryland,
    : null
    at that time, it was is a changing time for the whole music scene, I guess: null
    at the same night we bought that Nat King Cole album, we bought Garth Brooks' album, No Fences.: null
    ? at the time that I was a teenager, a late teenager I guess, I can't remember
      the year, SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES became popular.
    : null
    at this point we're going to kind of wait, I think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway: null
    back a long time ago, when the rap music first came out: null
    back then when I was a kid, there wasn't that much T V,: null
    basically I can tell you that I like just about every music there is except for, real hard, hard rock,: null
    basically because that's where I worked.: null
    basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions.: null
    both my sons play string instruments.: null
    both of them, I had as much fascination of the background music, I think going on as I did to the theme of the shows,: null
    but I enjoy it, though.: null
    but at least I do sing in it .: null
    but that's who I go for .: null
    but the same type of thing.: null
    but, see, I played the piano: null
    clarinet is my primary instrument,: null
    come to think of it, I think that was a cover version of, a John Lee Hooker song, or something,: null
    consequently we wind up, wound up playing a lot of classical music there: null
    definitely,: null
    disco was pretty much dead by then.: null
    disco wasn't really my time.: null
    do you know who Chuck Mangione is?: null
    down in Texas, little, listen to a little country every now and then.: null
    enjoy it, but not for profession, no.: null
    especially my dad, likes a lot of classical music: null
    especially with something where you have to f, you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt.: null
    ? essentially I was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that
      I, for one reason or another I didn't pay much attention to music,
    : null
    even every once in a while I put it on myself,: null
    even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it.: null
    ? even when I was a teenager I didn't really like the music of that period so
      much because I found I liked, a little bit more melodious music than what was
      often the popular,
    : null
    even when I was pregnant, of course I listened to that,: null
    ever since I've been out of college, I guess over the last several years, I listen to the stereo less and less.: null
    every now and then country and western.: null
    every single Sunday night we play at the library to have a little: null
    everything I listen to is what I buy, not whatever they play on the radio: null
    except heavy metal: null
    for example, I used to like old Phil Collins.: null
    for example, let's say you're taking an original Brazilian form of music and, with a certain style,: null
    for example, let's see, Bad Company,: null
    for example, they have, what,: null
    for instance, Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition: null
    ? for my playing the piano when I was depressed and didn't have anything else
      to do and there was no one to play with I could always go play with the piano,
      you know.
    : null
    gosh it's so hard because, everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done,: null
    h, he hasn't really gotten into, that yet.: null
    had a real raspy voice,: null
    he came out with the Invisible Touch, with, Genesis: null
    he came out with, for example, his, his record No Jacket Required.: null
    he can go if they get sixteen dollar tickets: null
    he can play, which is kind of interesting.: null
    he can't hear me.: null
    he can't learn like that.: null
    he didn't have anyone to play it.: null
    he does have some things.: null
    he does it,: null
    he doesn't even like that type of stuff.: null
    he goes out of his way to play marching band music,: null
    he grew up in the late fifties: null
    he had skipped bail: null
    he had, they had a, nickelodeon, of course, in the restaurant,: null
    he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in,: null
    he has a lot of all different kinds of music,: null
    he has played.: null
    he introduced my brother and I both, to a lot of it.: null
    he is, he's a home boy .: null
    he just became a grandfather.: null
    he likes a little bit of every kind.: null
    he likes that.: null
    he likes to do special music and stuff at church.: null
    he played in the band when he was in college and in high school: null
    he plays in the Fort Worth Symphony and Fort Worth mostly.: null
    he plays piano.: null
    he plays pretty regularly.: null
    he plays that and, and a little bit of piano: null
    he plays wonderfully.: null
    he really likes Shenandoah.: null
    he said he's lost most of his hearing: null
    he said it was a great seat.: null
    he said it was the best thing he'd ever seen: null
    he said that this woman this socialite in Plano had hired four guys to kill her husband: null
    he said, I can make a lot of money just singing alone,: null
    he said, Sure,: null
    he sure is,: null
    he thinks that would be good for the kids .: null
    he went and bought one of the low priced student tickets,: null
    he went to New York with them,: null
    he went to New York,: null
    he's a jazz flute player: null
    he's a jazz performer,: null
    he's always liked it: null
    he's been to see PHANTOM, and LES MISERABLES and bunch of other things up there,: null
    he's coming to Dallas on the twentyninth,: null
    he's going to testify for the State against her so he'll have his sentence reduced.: null
    he's identified the, the people that have written certain songs,: null
    he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet.: null
    he's playing with Robbie Shoncar,: null
    he's probably about fiftythree years old now,: null
    he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy: null
    he's, he's about ready to retire, another year: null
    he, he got off right away.: null
    he, he is real fun to listen to.: null
    he, he likes some of the new groups like Shenandoah,: null
    he, he since then has, has amended that, and paid them his royalties every time the, the song goes on: null
    he, he's been to, they've been to see it several times.: null
    he, he's real unusual in that,: null
    heard this, these, we heard this fiddler: null
    his children are very musical,: null
    his mother is very musical,: null
    his, his home town is about, fifteen minutes away: null
    his, my brother plays,: null
    however, I, I do, I do like a lot of different forms of music: null
    i, it's interesting because you were, you were saying that you liked classical music: null
    i, it, it just isn't chance taking enough for me.: null
    if I get involved in one of those things, I end up spending all my money on: null
    if I really like the song, eventually I'll figure out who it was.: null
    if I work real hard I can still barely read the music,: null
    if it is performed correctly or if it's done right, or if the version is done right, I like it ,: null
    if some, some group just isn't going to play any more, they'll just give us their music, and that type of thing.: null
    if that's what, if that's what the punishment is in that, in that instance, then you're always going to say, not gui,: null
    if you like the artist, you buy the album.: null
    if you recall how it goes downtown,: null
    if you're trying to hold out, there's so much pressure on you: null
    if you, if you don't believe, if this was a capital crime and, and you don't believe in: null
    if, if it's not, then I won't.: null
    if, when the Doors movie came out, Doors was really on the radio there,: null
    in Oklahoma we say Garth Brooks .: null
    in Salisbury, you woul, that's all you would hear was, This is the Doors!,: null
    ? in a, in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there
      which is always frustrating for me since I have pretty high math aptitude
    : null
    in concert band I played the bass clarinet.: null
    in fact I think both of them have performed here.: null
    in fact most of my C D s are classical music.: null
    in fact they have, they have a continuous news station, which is nice if you're driving and you want to h,: null
    in fact we have a album ...: null
    in fact, I had a harpsichord played at my wedding.: null
    in fact, one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to Chopin, that is played on, piano.: null
    in fact, that's about the only musical thing that I still do: null
    in fact, whenever she won her big Grammy: null
    in fourth grade I started the clarinet,: null
    in other words: null
    in seventyeight, rock was starting to get really heavy,: null
    in the winter we do more concert stuff: null
    inevitably I am swept away by the, the pressure of other types of things,: null
    is that kind of music ,: null
    is the turns out I was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to,: null
    is what I really listen to most of the time.: null
    it actually doesn't matter who shows up,: null
    it alternates quite a lot.: null
    it becomes a kind of music of its own.: null
    it doesn't have, all the brass and everything.: null
    it doesn't,: null
    it doesn't.: null
    it gives me an out.: null
    it is excellent.: null
    it is one of my favorite periods.: null
    it is, high quality grade music,: null
    it just didn't work out to do that now.: null
    it just opened in New York this spring,: null
    ? it kind of makes me listen a little closer to, to the piano when I hear it at
      other places, or when I, see some, see and hear someone playing.
    : null
    it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was easy access,: null
    it makes an elegant wedding to have: null
    it makes, it makes it nice.: null
    it matters what instruments they brought,: null
    it may have, it may have been somebody else, because I think, I think that even Jimi Hendrix did it,: null
    it might be classical,: null
    it might be rock,: null
    it really changed my lifestyle and kept me from just having a, easy access to current music,: null
    it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials: null
    it seems like almost a opposite,: null
    it sure is,: null
    ? it was a change, from your traditional, normal, stuff, and since it was Christmas
      time and, and, we had the church decorated with Christmas hollies and poinsettias
      and, stuff like that
    : null
    it was a living, it was a living person that I'm, I'm thinking of that,: null
    it was about,: null
    it was country music,: null
    it was for a murder trial.: null
    it was incredible, the parallel, between it and rap.: null
    it was just like,: null
    it was just so wonderful.: null
    it was just, he said that, that just about what you said, that he just liked all kinds of music.: null
    it was out, out at the State Fair Music Hall: null
    it was real nice,: null
    it was real nice.: null
    it was really funny .: null
    it was really old.: null
    it was somewhat melodious,: null
    it was sort of a funny thing.: null
    it was, mostly all Irish tunes,: null
    it wasn't part of what I knew,: null
    it will always be there.: null
    it's a cross between a tuba and, and an, and, a horn.: null
    it's a euphonium.: null
    it's a little too, ronky tonk or something.: null
    it's a lot of work to see that she's prepared: null
    it's a similar thing.: null
    it's always a mystery,: null
    it's been fun,: null
    it's been fun.: null
    it's been good for our family.: null
    it's been two or three years ago now,: null
    it's got a, a whole bunch of people singing.: null
    it's hard to explain .: null
    it's it is instrumental.: null
    it's just a real basic class,: null
    it's just difficult for me to believe that anybody's ever going to make a, a record of the rap songs of the eighties.: null
    it's just one of those things I'm just going to wait and see if he's interested: null
    it's kind of boring standing there, putting on makeup, so I'll turn the radio on: null
    it's kind of fun to listen to the: null
    it's kind of hard to choose sometimes.: null
    it's kind of like a small, small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder.: null
    it's like Elijah, or something like that.: null
    it's like, nothing happened during the seventies.: null
    it's mainly, it's mainly just the, the light rock type stuff.: null
    it's making that, that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it.: null
    it's more of a, I think it's very much more of a social group than anything else,: null
    it's ninth, nine through twelve: null
    it's not always classical as, the official, word might go,: null
    it's not as, it's not like, Chicago where it's got that much instrument to it.: null
    it's not, it's, it's nice,: null
    it's pretty good.: null
    it's pretty varied.: null
    it's really cute.: null
    it's really weird stuff, he likes,: null
    it's sitting here mostly taking up space,: null
    it's so funny, because you can take an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself.: null
    it's something that interests me, combined with, with the classical tastes I had mentioned.: null
    it's the end is, really depressing.: null
    it's the music,: null
    it's the po, the music I enjoy the most.: null
    it's the same stuff.: null
    it's the same way with,: null
    it's tough, I think I would just stick with the classics. Only because, I like music just for music's sake: null
    it's, business technology.: null
    it's, it's got men and women: null
    it's, it's got people singing: null
    it's, it's got people singing,: null
    it's, it's got to have a point to it.: null
    it's, it's pretty, fairly well easily to something to fall into.: null
    it, it can't be the rock or anything like that: null
    it, it, it'll, if it stands the test of time, we'll see.: null
    jazz can get on my nerves after a while.: null
    just a little bit .: null
    just about any kind of music except acid rock ,: null
    just about any kind of music.: null
    just by itself.: null
    just nothing basically .: null
    just, different backgrounds.: null
    keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times I bang on them.: null
    kind of pop, you know, rock.: null
    knowing from what my daughter has gone through, she's, she learned a lot: null
    last year or the year before, I can't remember,: null
    life just took different turns here: null
    like Depressed Mode,: null
    like I say the acid rock,: null
    like you, I don't know a whole lot about it,: null
    like, like Hank Williams.: null
    lot of stuff that actually has, ended up becoming popular like, Nirvana and,: null
    lot of the stuff I was listening to in my teens like the Clash and, and the Sex Pistols and: null
    lots of different kinds I guess.: null
    lots of times,: null
    ma, maybe it wasn't that one.: null
    machines will eat them,: null
    many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they, just real talented: null
    maybe one of these days, I'll,: null
    me and my brother both took the classes: null
    mid to late seventies, between seventyfive and,: null
    more like, rock, like Led Zepplin type .: null
    most of my cassettes,: null
    most rap I don't like.: null
    most, most likely I would be listen to, jazz or classical music.: null
    mostly folk music.: null
    mostly it, it just tells a story about life.: null
    mostly oldies.: null
    much of the music that was popular at that time, has come back.: null
    my band is sponsored through what they call Parks and Recreation.: null
    my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds, early eighteen hundred music.: null
    my daughter just fell.: null
    my daughter takes piano lessons, too.: null
    my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing.: null
    my early popular music interests were in Simon and Garfunkel, whom I saw perform when I was in college: null
    ? my family now knows if they come into my study and, I happen to have had a tough
      day at work and maybe I'm trying to get a project done, at school, and I'm humming
      or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to Downtown they know to just
      stay away,
    : null
    my favorite type of music is classical music,: null

    my teenagers are all gone.: null
    my third son just started baritone this year,: null
    my trumpet teacher used to play in the Fort Worth Opera.: null

    my, my oldest is only nine.: null
    my, my parents still, really like country,: null
    my, my, my,: null
    naturally that isn't their taste: null
    neither of them stayed with it .: null
    nobody cared to name it .: null
    not all the time.: null
    not because there's much else .: null
    not many things you can play that'll, people will sit there and sing along to: null
    not that kind of music .: null
    not, I do, the world a favor: null
    now I don't have a piano in my apartment or anything.: null
    now I grew up in the late fifties and early sixties,: null
    now I know another reason why I'm not going to get a C D player for a while.: null
    now I listen to it whenever she does.: null
    now I've, for about the last eight years I've sung in a church choir here,: null
    now he is in Massachusetts.: null
    now my children have, have sometimes,: null
    now my, my four year old, four and a half year old daughter is, is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play: null
    now that I do have one, I just don't automatically turn it on: null
    now you can get one for two or three dollars.: null
    now, I hate Phil Collins,: null
    occasionally, when she can't get those people, we use just E flat trumpets, with valves: null
    of course, it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it.: null
    of course, now they're getting, they also have a jazz section,: null
    on any given night there's not seventy: null
    one of the,: null
    one of them said, everything is great,: null
    one thing is, we have a summer ser, summer series,: null
    one thing that's helped us a lot is that, you, you can buy a lot of these operas now on video casse, video tape: null
    one time I remember, this was back when, even,: null
    only I, I should, should have been.: null
    only the Fort Worth Opera .: null
    other bands consider it really hard rock.: null
    other than that, I like pretty much everything.: null
    ? other than that, I've, I really don't, I don't listen to the radio or even to
      my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore.
    : null
    over time I became very interested in, in baroque classical: null
    people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and: null
    people have picked up on it.: null
    pretty much a lot of people would know about it, and, and know some of the different things about it: null
    pretty much anything.: null
    probably about first grade,: null
    probably not.: null
    probably the favorite instrument would be, the violin.: null
    quite honestly, I, I have some little children: null
    real long legs,: null
    really weird names, The Dead Milkman,: null
    really, heavy metal, wo, is considered, the words heavy metal: null
    right now I'm just a homemaker,: null
    right now my nine year old is taking piano,: null
    right now, I think.: null
    seeing as how I'm a musician , I like all kinds of music.: null
    several years ago a radio broke in my car: null
    she actually does some very nice chording just naturally.: null
    she gave it to me.: null
    she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been, getting cocaine from his client and then selling it,: null
    she laughed: null
    she played bass clarinet during concert band.: null
    she said, It's very similar,: null
    she said, when I was a teenager, that had been,: null
    she slipped.: null
    she thinks its pretty funny how often I know all of the words to songs that she's listening to,: null
    she wanted, she just seemed to enjoy it so much: null
    she's got black hair,: null
    she's got the, the cassette, so she can record off cassettes onto C D s.: null
    she's gotten some, she's been on the top ten, I guess, or whatever.: null
    she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally.: null
    she's playing the piano.: null
    she's, we've, started her on piano: null
    she, she gets the wrong note every now and then.: null
    should I say seven.: null
    since I've started back into school now, I haven't really done that much.: null
    so because of that, I can't read music as well as I used to,: null
    some of the punk, when I was in high school, that was, one of the big things, was punk music,: null
    some of the, some of the rock stations now are the, I guess the top forty stations or whatever.: null
    some of their older s, stuff was, quite enjoyable to me.: null
    some of them are.: null
    some of these groups now like Slaughter .: null
    some of those old ones, of course, Bob Wills, Miss Texas Playboys: null
    some years before, she said, that was a version of, a song then.: null
    some, I don't even, I recognize the, the melodies, and whatnot,: null
    somebody played it .: null
    somebody tried to call me last night: null
    something like that,: null
    sometimes I enjoy listening to, fiddle music.: null
    sometimes I'll listen to jazz,: null
    sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it.: null
    sometimes they kind of get on a, a, a binge,: null
    stuff like that.: null
    ? taking those, those qualities, and then applying, in the styles, that are really,
      that are extremely enjoyable, and then taking,
    : null
    talking about that so far as Christian life, too,: null
    that fills a stage and keeps us busy,: null
    that is not, there is, things written for Doc Severenson and, a few other people.: null
    that kind I kind of like.: null
    that they take tours and things like that: null
    that type of country western is: null
    that was a real interesting time: null
    that was about the same time I was taking piano.: null
    that was my teenage years.: null
    that was really fun.: null
    that was the instrument both of my children started on,: null
    that was the one with Mickey Rooney: null
    that was, that was neat for, for me to hear that somebody is,: null
    that worked out very nicely.: null
    that'll be good.: null
    that's about all I can feel apt to discuss with you since I just know,: null
    that's about how I am on popular music.: null
    that's about it.: null
    that's all you had to listen to was the,: null
    ? that's amazing how I used to, when I was in college, I used to have the stereo
      on all the time or I had on M T V or something,
    : null
    that's been, it's been fun,: null
    that's exactly the same thing my exwife did .: null
    that's how it works.: null
    that's just,: null
    that's kind of my volunteer thing,: null
    that's not by my choice.: null
    that's one of things I felt like I missed in life: null
    that's one thing I like about the, some of the folk music scenes,: null
    that's probably my alltime favorite.: null
    that's really what I like better,: null
    that's the same with me, same with me.: null
    that's the way I am, too,: null
    that's usually what's hot around here: null
    that's what I know,: null
    that's what I mean,: null
    that's what he grew up listening to.: null
    that's when, that's when they took, toured.: null
    that's where I got my,: null
    that's where my two, my two listening enjoyments are,: null
    that's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together.: null
    that's, Puccini, I think,: null
    that's, that's about my opinion of that .: null
    that's, that's the other guy I was thinking of was Garth Brooks.: null
    that's, that's what gets me mad.: null
    that's, that's what they do.: null
    that's, those are, that's my favorite type.: null
    that, that would be inconvenient because I have a cassette player in my car.: null
    the Moody Blues,: null
    the acting was particularly nice, I thought,: null
    the album oriented like the, James Taylor,: null
    the best example the cream of the crop, I guess you could say,: null
    the difference in the radio with popular music,: null
    the difference, I guess, between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also.: null
    the friend David went,: null
    the guitar is set really low,: null
    the last country music,: null
    the last one we did was in a large, mall close here,: null
    the last time they went up, a friend of his wanted to go,: null
    the more popular music I don't care for, usually.: null
    the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound.: null
    the new one's in this thirties: null
    the old, old stuff that came out, I think it was, Hank Williams,: null
    the one D J said, who the heck is Bonnie Rait and why does she deserve five Grammies?: null
    the one that's accused was the one that actually did it.: null
    the one thing I do object to about rap music is, is when it becomes militant,: null
    the only, we only had one radio station: null
    the other one is, the boy is, guitar and, and percussion,: null
    the other one plays the viola.: null
    the places we've gone they sing in the original languages.: null
    the price of cassettes has gone down: null
    the pro, problem that I found, in this area is that the, there, there is inconsistency in the quality: null
    the rest of them are just parts .: null
    the seventies I don't know what they're called,: null
    the seventies got nothing.: null
    the subject of music .: null
    the trial won't take place until June.: null
    the two of them have played natural trumpets .: null
    ? the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times. I've heard some songs that,
      that I just thought were horrendous cover versions of,
    : null
    the, Dallas opera now has, super titles on, on all their performances I think.: null
    the, I just like the melodies more: null
    the, the eighties are called, the progressive years, or the, or, the technology years,: null
    the, the piece of music, the piece of music was about, I think about forty or fifty years old.: null
    their concert schedule isn't as heavy,: null
    then I got interested in a lot of other things: null
    then I have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer: null
    then I must say they all kind of like a variety of music, which is nice,: null
    then he buys the pieces that have that person.: null
    then she keeps repeating it, practice makes perfect,: null
    then there's the, Dolly Parton, Hollywood sound.: null
    there are a lot, there are so many different songs,: null
    there are some, types of heavy metal that I really like,: null
    there usually,: null
    there was a Peter Frampton song,: null
    there was an Agape music group,: null
    there was twenty students from high school that went,: null
    there's a couple of nice, small coffee houses up in New Jersey.: null
    there's a lot.: null
    there's another band around here.: null
    there's certain types of country western I can't handle: null
    there's one gal that's in the, Plano Community Orchestra.: null
    there's one in particular that is on both A M and F M so I can listen to it without, worrying.: null
    there's one that's, a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect.: null
    there's probably something else that might make you.: null
    there's some joy in it also.: null
    there's such a wide selection,: null
    there, there's a Conway Twitty twang,: null
    these are a bunch of old recordings.: null
    they actually have them perform the music,: null
    they also have a, more contemporary and American: null
    they also, they also, go to the different composers, or the different, I guess,: null
    they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in, in progression, ever in history.: null
    they both loved the movie, right?: null
    they ca, play college level music in junior high,: null
    they did it again, about two or three years ago,: null
    they do their, they do a lot of original recordings themselves.: null
    they end up playing a lot of the high notes,: null
    they finally extradited him: null
    they get worse and worse, too.: null
    they got tickets for the opening night.: null
    ? they had a band with him that, had a harpist and another flute and then a guy
      that played the bagpipes plus the, tin whistle,
    : null
    they had us fill out a long questionnaire.: null
    they have more in the summer,: null
    they have on Saturday night, Friday night and Saturday night: null
    they have subtitles,: null
    they have that type of music,: null
    they hit each other with their shoulders,: null
    they just bump into each other,: null
    they just had the baby's christening: null
    they just have different words: null
    they just talk about, life in general.: null
    they keep on replacing them: null
    they know have them on compact disc or: null
    they play the same sort of thing over and over again, without really necessarily quality.: null
    they record it.: null
    they said it was, it was great, it was great.: null
    they say it's going to last about two to three weeks.: null
    they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players.: null
    they sold the piano,: null
    they start dancing around,: null
    they usually do a lot of satire: null
    they want to play things that, push them to do.: null
    they went and tried out: null
    they went out and bought us a piano: null
    they went to it,: null
    they were both excellent.: null
    they were really, really expensive: null
    they were, half have been professionals from, a lot of them are from, faculty at Penn State here.: null
    they will kno,: null
    they will, record the music at that time.: null
    they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time: null
    they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas.: null
    they're like, for example, A C D C.: null
    they're they are still on tour.: null
    they're, called Odessa.: null
    they're, none of them are recent, right.: null
    they're, they're like late forties, early fifties,: null
    they're, they're still around,: null
    they're, they're trying to make it somewhat more modern.: null
    they're, they've been doing a lot of that in the area.: null
    they've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of Christian musicians that come to our youth group at our church.: null
    they've got a ne, new C D out,: null
    they, they do, they do copy versions, they do cover versions of, of, standards, I guess you could call it.: null
    they, they don't talk about that,: null
    they, they gave him the seat that normally belongs to John Bel John .: null
    they, they give an, an English translation on a, on a screen up above the stage.: null
    they, they like, they like the Oak Ridge Boys and the Statler Brothers,: null
    they, they might weed you out some other way.: null
    they, they played all the Irish jigs and so forth,: null
    things like that I like to listen to.: null
    think about like the Twin Peaks and stuff like that: null
    this guy in front of me said, I can't believe I was summonsed.: null
    this is Hank Williams: null
    ? this same child, really listened to more, ballady or, pleasant sort of songs
      rather than, and even classical, rather than the real hard rock stuff that so
      many other kids listen to.
    : null
    those go back quite a way .: null
    those, two guys who wrote LES MIS wrote a new show call MISS SAIGON .: null
    very often the artist will have a d, an album: null
    vowed that someone in the family was going to learn,: null
    warped real easy.: null
    was about fortyfive miles away: null
    we all had to take lessons,: null
    we bought his, we bought his tape: null
    we can borrow music from any of the area colleges: null
    we can have music in the classroom,: null

    we do an awful lot of,: null
    we do get an awful lot of music,: null
    we do get some money from the city: null
    we do like the ,: null
    we do that every Sunday night: null
    we don't charge for any of our performances,: null
    we don't have a C D yet, do you?: null
    we don't, now we don't listen to much country,: null
    we enjoy watching the country and the Grammies and stuff: null
    we get a lot of donations.: null
    we got Simply Red.: null
    we got a big group going down to hear him sing a bunch of, Andrew Lloyd Webber's music.: null
    we have a home computer,: null
    we have quite a collection of those,: null
    we have to watch that.: null
    we have, all his records so far,: null
    we have, four records of his.: null
    we haven't either,: null
    we hire lots of instrumentalists off and on for, different things.: null
    we hire, we hire an orchestra at least twice a year and then different instrumentalists off and on through out the year.: null
    we just got a disk the other day that was a, disk of Nat, Nat King Cole's greatest hits: null
    we just really like music.: null
    we played Christmas about an hour out in this mall.: null
    we played, old fashioned Christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not,: null
    we rehearse once a week.: null
    we sure don't.: null
    we try to make contact with them periodically to see what's going on and stuff, too,: null
    we used to go and listen to them all the time: null
    we used to have, Ralph Dutchen.: null
    we used to listen to it full blast .: null
    we went, wow: null
    we're expecting a baby in July.: null
    we're in Garland.: null
    ? we're just having to turn a lot of people down, because, we don't want to do
      things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row.
    : null
    we're just not too far apart,: null
    we're kind of waiting to, now,: null
    we're kind of,: null
    we're learning a lot,: null
    we're still in contact with each other.: null
    we've been talking for seven minutes,: null
    we've got about five of those.: null
    we've got friends that are in the music business that go around Dallas,: null
    we've gotten to know each other quite well, in, on a, a social level,: null
    we've had a lot of stuff, friends and, and things to do with music that constant,: null
    we've heard them and, liked, liked it real well, of course .: null
    we, are a group of, musicians that just kind of have, formed out of a desire to sing: null
    we, we like the, the idea of having great extra quality,: null
    we, we watch those award shows too,: null
    we, we're very similarly aged,: null
    well they'll,: null
    what I got the most exposure to: null
    what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music,: null
    what happened was that Phil Collins said, hey I can make money, a lot of money doing this,: null
    what happens is everybody gets totally into the music: null
    what happens is, the old, whe,: null
    what you do is, you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people.: null
    what, she's losing her sight or whatever.: null
    what, what Merle Haggard: null
    whatsever's on the radio is, is usually okay with me,: null
    ? when I do play, and begin to reacquire skills I inevitably fall in love with
      country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a, for
      a new piano player.
    : null
    when I heard his album, I heard it and it was just incredible.: null
    when I listen to music most of the time that's what I listen to.: null
    when I went more rural, that, it really changed.: null
    when I would go into his,: null
    when he played DANNY BOY it just almost brought,: null
    when it came to my turn the folks said no we're not going through that again,: null
    when it was just starting,: null
    when my friend played something on the piano and he played it, with his right hand,: null
    when our first child was, an infant, of course, when I was around the house, I played that music, too.: null
    when they buy a tape or something, sometimes that's fun because it's different and something I've not always heard,: null
    when they hear it, it, it's a really, it's another form of music, and,: null
    when they would come and change the records the guys would, the guy would give her the old records: null
    whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement .: null
    who's a very good, he's a very good arranger.: null
    world music is,: null
    world music takes the forms that have really been,: null
    yet, I, I have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music: null
    you always thought about, suicide. And killing people and stuff like that.: null
    you can enjoy it in the, theater.: null

    you knock people down,: null
    you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it: null
    you know those little booklets that come along with it: null

    I guess I can just humor them, . At this point.: null
    I guess I didn't really consider that heavy metal.: null
    I guess our age is showing when, we, we think that.: null
    I guess that covers it.: null
    I guess there was even a, a bit of ruckus caused by the M C Hammer, who's really,: null
    I guess you could say it's similar as far as: null
    I guess, one of these days when I get a new car, maybe, I guess all of them will probably have C D s players by then,: null
    I haven't really been up to date on a lot of music.: null

    I think I, I might like dancing to it: null
    I think everybody took piano lessons: null
    I think his name in, in the movie was Froggy: null
    ? I think if you would listen to it a little, you would discover that it has a

      roll of the era that, that we both lived through.

    I think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the, since he was a baby.: null
    I think it's just incredible.: null
    ? I think it's kind of absurd, the fact that, they don't really, they don't really
      give, the original artist, or the original composer,

    I think life is just music,: null
    I think my parents have have, some of his records.: null
    I think piano is always good background,: null
    I think some of them, the artists are even, hitting the pop charts.: null
    I think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer.: null
    I think that they don't use, elec,: null
    I think that's great.: null
    I think that's pretty much, bull.: null
    I think there's music all around anyway.: null
    ? I think with, in a way one could talk about Simon and Garfunkel that way because
      they do tend, to have a dramatic or story approach to their music, usually tend
      to have some good or bad moral to it.
    : null
    I think, I think they're a bit over exposed .: null
    I think, if somebody else were to play that, they wouldn't, they, nobody, everybody would think, that's lousy,: null
    I thought it was hideous.: null
    I'm impressed.: null
    I'm sure it is.: null
    I'm sure that it, for you, it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself,: null
    I'm sure that, that so, that sold a lot for him.: null
    I'm sure there's a lot of that down there.: null
    I'm surprised you didn't go to, to any pa, parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff: null
    I'm, I'm sure you could find old players for them: null
    I, I don't, I don't think Gun,: null
    I, I find that the classical music is very good for the kids too, it doesn't disturb them: null
    I, I guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening.: null
    I, I know, whenever they talk about, country music, it's about, it seems sad to me.: null
    I, I must admit that's, they're fantastic,: null
    I, I think a good one was,: null
    I, I think that the piano background is very, useful,: null
    I, I think, I, I know who that is,: null
    I, I, I think most artists are in to make a few bucks.: null
    I, he, he is really good.: null
    If, it's, it's interesting.: null
    In order to continue to, to grow and: null
    It always sounds like,: null
    It is a nice combination.: null
    It is real relaxing.: null
    It is wonderful.: null
    It just seems like there's no, no real point.: null
    It really does.: null
    It seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music.: null
    It seems like a lot of Churches are hiring more musicians now than they use to.: null
    It seems like every week they pick ten: null
    It seems to be so popular these days.: null
    It's almost,: null
    It's always about some guy losing some girl and then, playing the guitar and singing about it.: null
    It's becoming not necessarily good music, just popular music,: null
    It's funny, depending on where you live,: null
    It's funny.: null
    It's good to cover all the bases there.: null
    It's just very wonderful. Soothing, and, lot of symphonies: null
    It's just, it's, it's way to hectic and too confusing.: null
    It's kind of sad that I've let that slip away.: null
    It's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning.: null
    It's not too hard,: null
    It's, it's okay,: null
    It's, it's, course country: null
    Kenny Rogers, he's kind of country western verge,: null
    Madonna can do anything: null
    Most Churches have the,: null
    Now, it's the other way around.: null
    Of course, there's not a whole lot of market for seventyeight R P M records.: null
    Of course, they, just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because,: null
    Ooh, you took on a,: null
    R E M makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being, ultra mainstream at this point,: null
    R E M really hasn't changed.: null
    She's got so much energy .: null
    She's real good. She's real good.: null
    She's something, though.: null
    Some of it is kind of: null
    Some of it's okay,: null
    Some of them are just really rough.: null
    That is fabulous.: null
    That often is the case,: null
    That was good,: null
    That would be good.: null
    That'll be a musician.: null
    That's a lot.: null
    That's all you really need for a lot of, lot of pop.: null
    That's good.: null
    That's kind: null
    That's pretty good.: null
    That's really hard I think, because, especially if you start them: null
    That's the most fascinating thing .: null
    That's, that's a little bit to,: null
    That's, that's,: null
    That, I think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does, some other kind of instrument,: null
    That, that would be, that would be nice .: null
    That, whenever they say it two or three times.: null
    The thing about country western that I don't enjoy is is, doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it: null
    The, the new stuff's kind of more like, today's rock and roll, which I,: null
    There's a big variation among the country,: null
    They are just so out of it.: null
    They are, the two of them are mainly pretty much the, they have cornered the market on trumpet.: null
    They came up with some pretty weird stuff after that.: null
    They destroyed it.: null
    They don't really,: null
    They just play a certain number of chords: null
    They're just kind of sweet sometimes.: null
    They're just so relaxing.: null
    They're nice that way.: null
    They're producing, similar music: null
    They're, they're not so, they're not so sad country all the time.: null
    Way, way more than I can stand down here.: null
    Which some of the songs on K V I L can.: null
    You are busy.: null
    You can only laugh .: null
    You could kill somebody with them .: null
    You hear the same, same tune over and over again: null
    You're, you're about like I am .: null
    You, you'd, you'd think there would be.: null
    Yuck looking,: null
    a lot of it is, has a lot to say, some of it has a lot to say, the music does, the lyrics do,: null
    a lot of them,: null
    also they get better quality: null
    and they have their faced all contorted,: null
    as far as a musical art form, I just don't see a whole lot of art to it .: null
    at least to my mind, Guns and Roses doesn't have too much of a message, too much to say.: null
    back to, I guess we'd better get back to music, though.: null
    because she did it, it's supposed to be good,: null
    blues are okay.: null
    but I think everybody can.: null
    folk music would be huge just because Madonna does it,: null
    for a while there, music seemed to really ha, popular music seemed to have, not a lot of point to it.: null
    has kind of the same sound over and over,: null
    he has a nice smooth voice.: null
    he looks like he's having a good time.: null
    he picked the right songs: null
    he was a phenomenon,: null
    he's a pretty nice guy.: null
    he's just, he's wonderful.: null
    he's that good of an instructor,: null
    he's, definitely one of the, one of the top of that era.: null
    heavy metal, it's noisy.: null
    if it survives, then it'll just probably be one or two songs that sort of, listen what we listened to .: null
    if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be, it'd be kind of fun, I think.: null
    if you don't, if you don't read the paper, you sort of fall behind if you're in,: null
    if you go two or three years without having that,: null
    if you, if you hear a lot of old gospel, especially the black gospel.: null
    it can get expensive: null
    it comes to the point where it's your name, not what you do: null
    it doesn't,: null
    it gets kind of old,: null
    it has grown from there.: null
    it has such a different sound to it, anyway.: null
    it is just,: null
    it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does .: null
    it just just looked like they,: null
    it just, it just doesn't do anything.: null
    it looked like leather day at the geriatric,: null
    it must be fun to be able to play it: null
    it seems like you get a lot of original music that way.: null
    it was great.: null
    it was just fabulous.: null
    it was on his way of going downhill,: null
    it was tremendous.: null
    it was, it was, I guess it was pretty bad times.: null
    it would be considered good because it's Madonna,: null
    it would not get performed by any, municipally funded, philharmonic,: null
    it's getting, getting pretty big everywhere, as I see it.: null
    it's good music: null
    it's just that, the, the sixties music's got a lot to say.: null
    it's just who does it,: null
    it's just, it's just, talking in a beat,: null
    it's kind of funny the way we listened to the stuff,: null
    it's kind of haunting, on, on some of the notes .: null
    it's kind of odd,: null
    it's like they don't want to talk about that,: null
    it's like, it doesn't have to be good,: null
    it's nice when you have a piece that, that is so, so peaceful,: null
    it's not r, terribly demanding.: null
    it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed.: null
    it's pretty good,: null
    it's really good.: null
    it's very hard: null
    it's very nice,: null
    it's, a lot of people l, saying that, bands in that position, sold out.: null
    it's, it's a different perspective on everything, too.: null
    it's, it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is.: null
    it's, it's pretty neat music: null
    it's, it's very interesting.: null
    it's, it's, it's not, it's not music,: null
    it's, it, sometimes it will skip.: null
    it's, music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays, I think.: null
    it, it's mostly relaxing: null
    it, it's the movie is so well made,: null
    it, it's, it's, it really expresses some of the opinions of, of the people who enjoy the music: null
    it, it, it, it, it has pieces that are uplifting,: null
    late, late sixties, early seventies, they were: null
    let's just put it that way,: null
    lot of the classics are really,: null
    maybe if you did like Hank Williams and Garth, maybe you would enjoy Tra, Randy Travis.: null
    maybe it is cause he is playing in Fort Worth .: null
    maybe it'll comfort her, when she's fussy and stuff.: null
    maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which I really like: null
    maybe you wouldn't like Randy Travis.: null
    most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious.: null
    music is kind of in a weird, it's in a very weird position right now.: null
    music is wrapped around now.: null
    ne, neither are tapes.: null
    now rock and roll seems tame compared to the New Age and all that stuff.: null
    now that there's just a million rap groups: null
    now there, there's some wonderful Christian music when you can find good stations.: null
    now you can even get books on tape,: null
    ? our generation was, so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness
      or badness with, things now with the music that's behinds them.
    : null
    our junior high band is just wonderful.: null
    parents always do.: null
    people always say, Wow! Th, the meanings of those words.: null
    really that's not world music.: null
    seems like it was on a Friday,: null
    seems to be the hot one of, of today.: null
    some of it is, some of it actually gets into some serious discussions of problems in our, in: null
    some of it sounds more like pop music.: null
    some of it,: null
    some people sing,: null
    sometimes it's hard to, to know exactly when,: null
    sounds, it sounds so much different: null
    th, there's too much T V now: null
    that does, that's something you don't, doesn't even sound good loud really.: null
    that had good music in it.: null
    that is a huge organization,: null
    that is not,: null
    that probably wouldn't be a problem,: null
    that sounds really cute.: null
    that was good,: null
    that would be gr, great if they weren't too worn out,: null
    that would cost a fortune,: null
    that's , that's what the, point we've reached,: null
    that's a good example to look for in history.: null
    that's a good thing to do.: null
    that's for sure.: null
    that's good though,: null
    that's interesting music,: null
    that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess.: null
    that's more, even more commercialized for of: null
    that's not music ,: null
    that's not music .: null
    that's not,: null
    that's pretty close.: null
    that's really, yeah that's, I bet that was nice.: null
    that's, that's nice to do, that is.: null
    that, it, it's really neat,: null
    that, that was a real good one.: null
    that, that was great.: null
    that, that whole record was pretty good.: null
    the best bet, any, anymo, these days are compact disk,: null
    the big key is that, I think you've already stated, that all music is rooted in the classics: null
    the comparison made between New Kids On The Block with the Beatles . It was just,: null
    the cover version, I think, I thought, was absolutely, it was pitiful.: null
    the drummer plays a certain beat,: null
    the first of Amy Grant before: null
    the kids just love him.: null
    the music in that was fantastic.: null
    the music that goes with it just picks you up,: null
    the old, old country,: null
    the older stuff is the best of it.: null
    the ones you buy,: null
    ? the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental
      so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are
    : null
    the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because,: null
    the radio is, more exciting,: null
    the type of music, at least to me, it's, sounds like it's only sounds good at a high volumes: null
    the, one country and western song sounds like every other,: null
    the, the musicians don't get to really get into their music.: null
    the, the, basic point of heavy metal w, which seems to be music to annoy you,: null
    then we got, we got some same things: null
    then, of course you like him.: null
    there are some of the few organizations that have the funds to, do big big works .: null
    there have been some nice folk songs over the years that, kind of still hang around.: null
    there was no reason for him to really come into, great stardom or anything.: null
    there was nothing,: null
    there's so much available: null
    there's some wonderful Christian, children's tapes.: null
    they come on the stage: null
    they don't actually look as rough as the Rolling Stones.: null
    they don't even know they are there.: null
    they don't have anything really important you want to hear.: null
    they get close, ten, eleven or something,: null
    they get pretty good: null
    they go, I don't want to do this anymore: null
    they just play them over and over,: null
    they just, don't name it.: null
    they just, they're not meant to last,: null
    they learn to have more features and things and: null
    they look pretty rough.: null
    they play the same songs over and over,: null
    they really are.: null
    they started getting a little more,: null
    they started going downhill like everybody else.: null
    they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably,: null
    they're good.: null
    they're interesting to listen to.: null
    they're just so thin and,: null
    they're not in it to say anything or give a message: null
    they're not the, the typical country where they're just, my wife left me, my dog left me, .: null
    they're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing,: null
    they're very harmonic: null
    they've all got, the real screechy electric guitars now.: null
    this stuff,: null
    those should be good albums.: null
    those things are practically indestructible .: null
    those, those are really nice.: null
    ugh, I didn't like that either.: null
    variety is good.: null
    was, became more mainstream, top forty.: null
    we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance,: null
    we have a, a marvelous band instructor,: null
    we probably have an in, interesting perspective on the music on the times,: null
    we strayed a lot from music.: null
    we'll have to keep up with that then.: null
    we're on totally different wavelengths.: null
    western even I've gotten a little bit used to because it's not like it used to be.: null
    what I like the most about him, is, } he always, he looks like he's having fun.: null
    what, what Paul Simon's doing, I think is, is, is great because he's, I think, I think that using,: null
    when you hear the cover it's like, God, what are they doing.: null
    when you listen to it, it's: null
    you can control it.: null
    you can hear it wherever you want: null
    you can't dance to it,: null
    you can't do anything to it .: null
    you can't just listen to it, to, especially a lot of the deeper stuff,: null
    you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs: null
    ? you don't, because it doesn't have words, you don't feel like, there's anything
      you have to remember, as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting
      what they mean
    : null
    you got a little ways to go, too .: null
    you have a country and western song: null
    you have to figure out what to buy,: null
    you must live in this area.: null
    you never hear the, you never hear the news basically on the radio.: null
    you never know where the talent is going to show up, I guess, sometimes.: null
    you never would think that they, that they can actually play together: null
    you sure do.: null
    you will, you can really pick it up.: null
    you're like: null
    you've got half a string quartet there.: null
    you, you listen a lot,: null
    you, you, you don't always quite get it right,: null

    I think it held probably,: null
    ? I think of all the time, now that my kids are gone and away and married and
      going to college or whatever, that I put in there, I just could not imagine
      a boat because I know it's a lot of maintenance.
    : null
    I think that was the last time we were really involved,: null
    I think, the thing I liked the best was, we spent about a summer: null
    I told everybody what happened: null
    I took sailing lessons when I was about six: null
    I used to ha, have a friend that owned, his daddy owned a boat shop.: null
    I used to sail about every day.: null
    I used to, kind of be that way myself when I lived in, north western Florida in the panhandle,: null
    I visited my cousin a couple of years ago, my wife and I: null
    I was down in the water and, and set to go: null
    I was in Florida ,: null
    I was kind of into it for a while there.: null
    I worked for a camp for a number of years.: null
    I'd get the boat out on the, Saturday,: null
    I'd have to go load it up the next day.: null
    I'd kind of like, someday, to maybe end up on a pair of skis that, that doesn't have a,: null
    I'd like to do some sailing.: null
    I'd say, I'm going to leave the boat out, because, we'll probably do this again tomorrow .: null
    I'd want to be with a skilled sailor .: null
    I'd work, go to work,: null
    I'll be if he didn't do it again.: null
    I'm a scout leader, though,: null
    I'm envious,: null
    I'm kind of into it.: null
    I'm not too much of a fisherman.: null
    I'm up in Minneapolis now,: null
    I'm, I'm out with,: null
    I'm, kind of a sailor.: null
    I've always thought, I bet that would be more fun.: null
    I've been to Oklahoma,: null
    I've never been to Texas.: null
    I've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat.: null
    I've never tried.: null
    I've never wanted to bad enough to make any effort to do it,: null
    I've sailed some.: null
    I've seen some nice, nice sailboats.: null
    I've, I've, done about all I dare do on skis. skiing on one and jumping around here and there: null
    I, I do enjoy the lake,: null
    I, I don't know that I ever learned to drive it or anything,: null
    I, I have, I had a boat last summer that I took out, a catamaran that I do, did a lot of sailing on and stuff.: null
    I, I work with a guy right now that, races catamarans in the summertime: null
    I, I've always thought I'd like to.: null
    I, I've had one for quite a few years,: null
    I, I've not had one the last couple of years.: null
    I, I, I know how you can get injured doing much more than that: null
    If you ever got it dumped over, though, it was a mess to get back up.: null
    Inboard outboard.: null
    It didn't hurt too much,: null
    It does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in: null
    It got to where the, tomorrow the boat was still sitting there: null
    It was fun,: null
    It was just a little nibble: null
    It was pretty nice,: null
    It was sort of neat.: null
    It wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it, upright again.: null
    It's a day sailer.: null
    It's east of here.: null
    It's real nice.: null

    Mount Vernon.: null
    My father was on staff there,: null
    My wife does .: null
    Nacogdoches.: null
    Nothing big.: null
    Nowadays I don't think I could afford the boat or the time, nor do we live that close to a lake anymore,: null
    People actually park their car when they get to their place they're staying, townhouse or condominium, whatever they own: null
    Probably seventies, eighties in the afternoon.: null
    That's another little thing.: null
    That's between Houston and Dallas.: null
    That's just a joke, I guess.: null
    That's where I grew up .: null
    The day you sell your boat.: null
    ? The guy that used to live next to us in Richardson before we moved twelve years
      ago, or whatever, he had a sailboat, used to park it right in the, driveway
    : null
    The, the laws were there: null
    They go to dinner that way, go to all the restaurants: null
    They'll allow you to ski backwards.: null
    They're getting kind of old: null
    This one you had to work with.: null
    ? This time a little earlier and, and I had let go before then and, before they
      took off this time and, and swatted him away.
    : null
    We go out with friends on the,: null
    We have, Lake Sam Rayburn out here and Lake Nacogdoches,: null
    We just worked all the time.: null
    We oftentimes got wet, .: null
    We spent a week with them.: null
    We went and, had a, kind of a picnic in the woods type thing.: null
    We'd enjoy it so much: null
    We're about thirty miles from Coco Beach and the east coast,: null
    You get out of the water again and get it upright.: null
    You need somebody to kind of tell you what to do,: null
    a friend of mine's dad is, was a program manager up there: null
    about the only memories that I have of boating,: null
    actually, I went, canoeing down the Brazos this weekend.: null
    all we, all we have up here mostly bass boats.: null
    as we visited, we were involved every weekend in just helping them redo this and refinish that.: null
    at this stage of the game, I'm not that interested in it anymore.: null
    aunt and uncle up in New York, they kept a boat on Jamaica Bay: null
    ? couple of guys, restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the midthirties
      and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real h, big old four foot center
      board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves,
    : null
    especial, we got two kids that are: null
    especially if you get a, a pretty fast boat: null
    for me, I, I go back to Orlando, in about a month, and so, down there, basically just go to the coast.: null
    for the most part.: null
    generally, everybody I've, I've known has kind of gotten into it,: null
    he had a boat: null
    he just moved down here to Mc,: null
    he usually goes on one of the Great Lakes, I think, and does his sailing.: null
    he's going off,: null
    he's pretty gassed about it.: null
    he's working in McKinney.: null
    if they want to go to the lounge to have a cocktail, they use the boat.: null
    if you didn't obey them,: null
    ? if you get a big enough one, then you've got a little motor on it also, where
      if it's light wind, you can still putt around a little bit and have fun.
    : null
    ? if you h, if you're a big enough boat to have the little auxiliary motor on
      there, at least you can kind of drop the sails and
    : null
    if, if the wind dies, you're not stuck in the,: null
    it bit enough to where I let go.: null
    it didn't even leave a mark.: null
    it just , we just moved down here a couple years ago,: null
    it must have slept four people anyway.: null
    it was a , big boat, big ski boat type thing.: null
    it was fun.: null
    it was maybe fifteen, twenty acres: null
    it was, , it had a lot of, turtles in it.: null
    it's , it's, it's fun.: null
    it's a lot of fun.: null
    it's down at Mount Vernon.: null
    it's for Cooper Industries.: null
    it's hard for me to get it somewhere: null
    it's just a hundred miles from here.: null
    it's pretty easy to get the hang of, I think: null
    it's something I've always enjoyed.: null
    it's, it's a nice, nice hobby to have.: null
    it's, it's not too bad,: null
    it's, n, Oklahoma's nothing like it.: null
    it, it was a nice, nice long skiing career,: null
    it, it would be kind of nice.: null
    ? it, it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while, just kind
      of get a feel for the wind and how it works and, and the physics behind it.
    : null
    it, it, it was heavy when we were there though.: null
    just as that boat took off, a turtle bit me in the middle of the back.: null
    ? just from what I've seen, you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around
      real quick , Grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let
      it whip you around.
    : null
    life just changes a little bit in that respect .: null
    little bit.: null
    ? maybe someday I'll , I'll get back to that as, after the kids are up and grown
      and the monies are there to get away for times on end, weekend or something.
    : null
    more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day: null
    my children all have been grown for a coup, few years: null
    my family's pretty into it: null
    my husband's family had a, a motor boat, when we got engaged: null
    my parents are pretty big sailors, too,: null
    now I've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me.: null
    once I get my son into and through with college, he's going to be starting, Rice next year: null
    once I get to that stage where I'm not paying for something else: null
    once the children were grown,: null
    our daughter and he had a place on Lake of the Ozarks: null
    our subject is on boating and sailing: null
    ? quite honestly, with the exception of being involved in a part ownership of
      a little bass boat, I have never really got into sailing or boating.
    : null
    ? sailing was, was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work
      your way down a lake or work back up against the, the wind, as it were, tacking
      back and forth
    : null
    sailing, I've never been sailing.: null
    supposed to be.: null
    that didn't always work.: null
    that was sort of a neat setup.: null
    that was sort of neat.: null
    that was twenty years ago, or twentyfive: null
    that's a good thing.: null
    that's all,: null
    that's good, because I didn't like Oklahoma that well .: null
    that's when you really start getting into speed.: null
    the boat went off without me: null
    the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to: null
    the sailing part of it I like because it's so quiet.: null
    the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now.: null
    the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing: null
    the wind came from the side: null
    their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen.: null
    there are supposed to be, some people f, moving down here from Colorado Springs for T I.: null
    there's a lot of places there you can go,: null
    they get pretty quick,: null
    they get so fast,: null
    they go, yeah, sure,: null
    they have a, worldwide,: null
    they hold their, you take care of them , they hold their value real well.: null
    they like us to take them out on their barge quite often,: null
    they offer classes out at, Ray Hubbard.: null
    they took us out on the lake several times.: null
    they're kind of into it.: null
    they, they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever.: null
    this one is not that big.: null
    those catamarans are pretty fast.: null
    w, all we do here is make transformers: null
    we decided to sell it.: null
    we did a lot of watering, , water sports.: null
    ? we did some water skiing, of course, and, and, driving around the lake in the
      boat and, and just the basic safety rules and things I found real interesting.
    : null
    we do a lot of boating on.: null
    we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts,: null
    we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here .: null
    we go out and take them out on their barge.: null
    we go to the lake just about every weekend down at Mount Vernon: null
    we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it.: null
    we had a n, different boat every day.: null
    we had a variety of boats at our disposal .: null
    we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats, sailboats, speedboats,: null
    we have a swimming pool at our house: null
    we haven't done m, l, whole lot of it lately.: null
    we love it up there .: null
    we never did go out again: null
    we take it out: null
    we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an older Chris Craft: null
    we used to, when I was in high school, we used to go out, go boating every day just about.: null
    we used to, when I was younger: null
    we were involved every weekend in just,: null
    we were using it less and less and less,: null
    we'd go down there: null
    we'd go every weekend.: null
    we'd go for a ride and enjoy it so much.: null
    we're supposed to be talking about boats,: null
    we're, we like it down here pretty good.: null
    what they call trick skis.: null
    with my little one, I've been out there many times: null
    would recommend it to anybody.: null
    you actually, some catamarans you can actually pull people behind, the skiers,: null
    you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of stuck your body out the hole,: null
    you go down I, you, you go down, yeah, thirty, thirty.: null
    you name it, they had it: null
    you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away.: null
    you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in: null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    Boats are kind of expensive to maintain.: null
    Especially a bigger one.: null
    I guess for the cost of them you don't really,: null
    I think you'll like it better,: null
    It takes a, a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up: null
    It's best done when you have leisure time: null
    It's probably the prettiest lake in the state of Texas.: null
    That had to have been fun.: null
    That sounds like a real challenge.: null
    That would be fun.: null
    They're all, yours: null
    he needs his weekends free, or: null
    it's a good company.: null
    it's hard on the f, your folks, too,: null
    it's hard to get,: null
    lot of people don't, don't see the excitement in sailing,: null
    my gosh, that had to be, that's boating.: null
    of course it's hard when you don't have any family around.: null
    some people are more motorboaters,: null
    that's about all we have .: null
    then, again, they may nev, m, they may never have tried anything like, catamaran: null
    they can be black holes to throw money into .: null
    things change, I guess.: null
    ? when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long, a
      boat can be a lot of relaxation, to especially with a group of friends and
    : null
    you couldn't complain about that.: null

    I've been unable to do that, because I hurt my foot about five years ago.: null
    I've been wanting to get a ten speed to ride around.: null

    I've never really looked into that.: null
    I've never, I'd, I was pretty much in shape walking: null
    I've noticed people doing that down here, too.: null
    ? I've noticed that what I do is that I have my towel that sits on the floor,
      so that every time I get up to bowl, I have to bend over to pick up my towel
    : null
    I've read a lot of information, knowing that to be true,: null
    I've really been faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out: null

    I've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and didn't with the other,: null

    I've tried to do that with sugar: null
    I've tried,: null
    I've tried.: null
    I've used the Nautilus equipment.: null
    ? I've, I think the most exercise I've gotten in the last three to four month

    I've, I've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my pulse rate, my resting pulse.: null
    I've, I've done some water exercises,: null
    I've, I've kind of gotten out of the habit myself,: null
    I've, I've kind of taken care of that.: null
    I've, just myself I just notice myself just really, real soft: null
    I, I always put it off.: null
    I, I am undisciplined in the sense that I can't just go and do exercise,: null
    I, I can believe that.: null
    I, I can tell you when I do do it on a regular basis I feel so much better: null
    I, I can't get out to dance all the time: null
    I, I do a little bit.: null
    I, I do all that.: null

    I, I increased,: null
    I, I intend, I keep saying I intend to get back into it.: null
    I, I just assumed that I had,: null
    I, I just, joined on my own: null
    I, I kind of got frightened,: null
    I, I kind of held her back a little bit this, this weekend.: null
    I, I kind of think it's, it's a lot of work: null
    I, I know that in, I just know that I'm going to get blown away with some, some piece of nonsense.: null
    I, I know that it's good for my health.: null
    I, I like biking: null
    I, I like to get exercise when I'm playing a game of some sort,: null
    I, I mostly jump rope more.: null
    ? I, I must say, that, when, when I did do a linguistics course in, in school,
      ages ago, the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent.

    I, I really hear that,: null
    I, I sometimes start little, much less, much more modest efforts,: null
    I, I sure wish she would.: null
    I, I think my ankles probably are my main weak point.: null

    I, I travel quite a bit in my: null
    I, I try to play, .: null
    I, I try to work out at least a couple of times a week,: null

    I, I went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred,: null
    I, I'm going to take it pretty seriously.: null
    I, I'm not the kind of person that could go to a spa: null
    I, I've really enjoyed just the activity: null
    ? I, I, I keep saying if somebody else would do it with me, I, that would be,
      little bit of peer pressure would help considerably.
    : null
    I, I, I like jogging,: null
    I, I, I love to swim,: null
    I, I, I really feel I can, I can dedicate about an hour, an hour and fifteen minutes f, to this effort.: null

    I, my bathing suit's just one piece,: null
    I, ride bicycles, , fifteen, twenty miles, I don't know, maybe three times, maybe four times a week.: null

    I, two years ago I started having trouble with my knee.: null
    I, weight train, three days on and one day off.: null
    I, when I did ride my friend's bike, that one time, I had, I don't know what I was trying to do.: null
    I, when I'd gotten back I had gotten some sun that day,: null
    If I can't swim I can't run, I should be able to swim.: null
    If I don't do it I just feel like I don't have as much energy.: null
    If I eat very much sugar, boy, just does something.: null
    If I feel too obligated to do it,: null
    If they had a pool here in Patterson I'd probably, put my bathing suit on and go down there,: null
    If you can control those three areas, then are you going to live longer, cause those are risk factors,: null

    It keeps me pretty busy,: null
    It kind of takes the time away: null
    It looked dark.: null
    It pushes you because you're pushing against the water: null
    ? It says ever, all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk
      about one rather than another, so that they, they combined them all together.

    Since it's more expensive, I think, Okay, you spent that much money, you'd better go .: null
    Situps, of course.: null
    So many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them.: null
    So walking seems to be a good solution for me: null
    So, I don't do,: null
    Sometimes I don't,: null
    Speaking for myself I don't sleep as well, when I am not exercising,: null
    Summertime only.: null
    Sunday the snow and ice came in.: null
    T I, where I work has, a fitness center: null
    Talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that.: null
    That didn't last long: null
    That happens to me probably one in four or five times that I swim.: null
    That is out for me.: null
    That was Tuesday night,: null
    That was a little bit too much money.: null
    That was his decision.: null
    That was just a waste of our our money.: null
    That will be very interesting.: null
    That's actually where this happened to me, out in, I say Plano,: null
    That's in Nevada.: null
    That's kind of the same thing for me.: null
    That's pretty upbeat,: null
    That's really cheap.: null
    That's that microscopic stuff,: null
    That's the one time in the day my husband and I can get away and talk: null
    That's the same way,: null
    That's way down towards the south.: null
    That's what I did with mine,: null
    That's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way, down the hallway.: null
    ? That's why, they, really stress, at T I, they really stress, staying in shape,
      stay in fit, overall fitness, no smoking and all that.
    : null
    That's, inside the mall: null
    The minimum they want you to do is three times a week.: null
    ? The only thing that I ever felt was, every time I stop and start going again,
      because I end up getting two jobs once in a while.
    : null
    The orthopedist called it a, basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you, and it snapped.: null
    The other woman didn't cook too much either.: null
    The problem is she's a school teacher: null
    The, the, the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here,: null
    Then I plan to get right back into it.: null
    Then I went back again a couple times and missed another time, and then kept missing and never went back again.: null
    Then it's got, some binoculars, and some pretty brass lamps.: null
    Then they diagnosed it,: null
    There I could barely make a couple of miles .: null
    There again, I'm just kind of a fledgling into this.: null
    There are a lot of, a lot of resources, a lot of magazines, and stuff,: null
    There is, there is a lot of good information out there, about health.: null
    There some things I'd like to try,: null
    There too, we've got a real active neighborhood association.: null
    There used to be one that was a twentyfour hour that I used to go to: null
    There was one guy I use to watch on E S P N,: null
    There were no heart attacks before we started using it: null
    There were none prior to nineteenhundred.: null
    There's Snow Bird or Alta.: null
    There's a nursery there.: null
    There's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex.: null
    There's one that's got some diamonds on it.: null
    There's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you.: null
    They call it aqua exercise, I guess is what they call it.: null
    They couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages .: null
    They even have some, aerobic, water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool.: null
    They have babies that are about the same ages as, as mine,: null
    They have got the track on the inside.: null
    They have probably, I'd say fifteen different, fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running,: null
    They have two types of water aerobics.: null
    They keep it at eightyone degrees yearround.: null
    They put a pin in it.: null
    They were all completely different.: null
    They're always in, in Hawaii some place.: null
    They're just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with: null
    They're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day.: null
    ? They're, people are putting in pools and, and completely redoing the outside
      restoring to the original, nineteen thirty, nineteen forties look.
    : null
    They're, they're getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty, a hundred and seventyfive thousand dollars.: null
    They've got a nice one.: null
    They've got a, mountain bike,: null
    They've got an olympic pool, and, and basketball courts and sand volleyball.: null
    ? They've got the full weight room and, the locker rooms with, a jacuzzi and sauna
      and the shower facilities, and hair dryers, and all the, everything you'd need
      just about.
    : null
    They've got two different aerobics rooms,: null
    Think someone can do it.: null
    Thirtyeight.: null
    This is going on my fourth week to do it.: null
    This one was only fortyfive dollars.: null
    This was in Louisiana.: null
    This weekend I cleaned out my closets: null
    This whole thing about,: null
    Those are probably the two main things I like to do.: null
    Too tired to exercise. *slash error: null
    Tried it on and decided I really did not like how it looked on me.: null
    U T A right here.: null
    University of Rochester.: null
    Up to a point,: null
    Washington is one of my favorite places to visit.: null
    Washington's a great place to do that.: null
    We all are,: null
    We all know each other,: null
    We belonged, for a period of time to the Signature Club for about a year.: null
    We don't have any kids yet: null
    We don't have facilities for swimming in winter,: null
    We enjoy doing it.: null
    We got it at a little bit of an incline.: null
    We have a little path that we do.: null
    We just bought a new home with a basketball hoop: null
    We live out in the country: null
    We used to try and belong to clubs or the Y, stuff like that,: null
    We went in together and hired a private instructor,: null
    We went to , whatever in Plano,: null
    We'll keep talking if we want to come up with something else.: null
    We're getting up in age, I guess, in our late thirties: null
    We're talking nineteen seventyeight.: null
    We've been having trouble with it the past few years,: null
    We've, we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough .: null
    We, we have, over here in Plano, a little recreation center that has got, a walking track,: null
    Wednesday night the radiologist called me at work: null
    When I was out walking, it, was more of a predawn type,: null
    When I was working up at, The Summit,: null
    When my wife lets me.: null
    ? With the stepper, you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically
      watching each step as it gets harder and down.
    : null
    With the walking, I think they said you need to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically beneficial.: null
    Years ago I used to, referee football: null
    Yo, you warm up: null
    You can get a fitness membership that allows you to use the facilities,: null
    You can get really sore.: null
    You can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too.: null
    You can usually find it in a health food store.: null
    You have to do a whole lot of sit ups: null
    You have to, you have to do it correctly,: null
    You name it, all kinds of stuff, flower beds.: null
    You sound like this girl that I talked to about books, and we got into movies one night.: null
    You wouldn't know that .: null
    You, you, you take the time to relax some how: null
    Young mothers.: null
    a Friday afternoon when I'm tired, it's the end of the week and I just want to go home. And I'll make myself go,: null
    a couple of weeks later I talked to the guy's roommate, in Virginia, about different things.: null
    a couple years ago I, too, got married.: null
    a friend of mine, suggested swimming: null
    a girl, one's in college,: null
    a long time ago I belonged to a gym: null
    a lot of people do that: null
    a lot of people wear those little, terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom. Especially around the pool.: null
    a lot of people, strain themselves doing it.: null
    a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends, we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill,: null
    a lot of times we're, we're up at the church: null
    a lot of times, tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty: null
    a while back I was more into basketball: null
    about fortyfive, fifty minutes.: null
    about the middle of the semester I ended up having to have surgery on my foot,: null
    actually I was up on a ladder, and, fell off.: null
    aerobics is something I'd hate to give up.: null
    after I get finished I feel great.: null
    after that we,: null
    after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells, and then build up to your, twentyfive pound dumbbells: null
    after that, I work out with weights.: null
    after the baby was born, since it wasn't premature, then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor.: null
    after the second baby was born I was going to go back to work,: null
    al, also last summer I was doing Nautilus: null
    all I did was weights and aerobic exercise: null
    all the same it is connected to my attitude,: null
    also that, that, it, my subconscious is working on things while I'm working: null
    also, that, that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles.: null
    and not only did I walk: null
    and the running,: null
    and there's a phone in here that's hilarious.: null
    and time consuming,: null
    any kind of meat: null
    anyway, it's got these beautiful watches on it.: null
    around Texas, you, you got about five or six,: null
    as I permanently damaged the, the cushion under my heel: null
    as a fit person .: null
    as a matter fact, I work out in the mornings.: null
    as far as I'm concerned, I have several other children: null
    as far as the working out and lifting and things like that. I, I can't say I really enjoyed it all that much,: null
    as matter of fact I was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position: null
    as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week.: null
    as soon as I had them, right back to it.: null
    as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out.: null
    as we were doing it, too, everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities.: null
    as we were jumping around or doing something I just jumped up and came right down on it.: null
    at first after it happened I thought, maybe that's a handicap access,: null
    at first we used it: null
    at that point that was sort of the limit: null
    at the end of the semester you go back in and your, your final exam is a three mile walk.: null
    at the gym, even in the class, I, w, e,: null
    at work we have a, a nice campus,: null
    at, to me, it's every minute's agony,: null
    back in her time, they liked women with big hips anyway: null
    basically at this point I'm, I'm a real walker.: null
    basically, I do it by myself in a group of maybe forty: null
    basically, I work on a campus: null
    basketball,: null
    because I'm constantly running my children around someplace: null
    because, boy, they seem like they really get out of shape,: null
    before that there was the running craze.: null
    boy if I go, in the summer time I try to jog, jog a couple of miles: null
    boy, I tell you what, I've been terrible ever since then.: null
    but a regular ten speed with those skinny tires,: null
    by the time I get home, all I want to do is just collapse or sit down at my computer: null
    by the time I get over the gym and, and go for my class and shower and get back to work, it is probably two hours or more: null
    by the time the final came around, I wasn't even where I could wear a shoe yet,: null
    by the time you get done you feeling really terrific.: null
    calculated down: null
    change of pace and just: null
    completely.: null
    currently, I'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program.: null
    depending on how many calls, I think three was the minimum.: null
    do that, stuff like that: null
    do your calisthenics,: null
    doing a mix of Nautilus and free weights. I like that.: null
    don't have to work at T I.: null
    during the summer, I'll do, at least seventyfive miles a week: null
    eight o'clock in the morning, was our class.: null
    even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now,: null
    even doing that three or four times a week, when summer hits, that's a hard thing to go out and: null
    even he was real concerned about that.: null
    even since I was about two or three.: null
    even though I can look at it as a task, the, I kind of get the, I get some kind of global benefit: null
    even with her taking all those e, expensive vitamins and stuff,: null
    evening time it gets pretty busy.: null
    ever since that, it's just been real difficult.: null
    ever, ever since I got out of school, just jumped right into the job: null
    every morning I use this President's, council of physical fitness: null
    every morning.: null
    every once in a while I play tennis,: null
    every other day I'd like to incorporate the video, and then the bike on the other day.: null
    every single woman in the audience is, about ten pounds.: null
    every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally: null
    every, every January and every September, I start out again: null
    everybody in their late twenties to midthirties are buying, and, and starting to rebuild and fix things up again: null
    everybody is real excited.: null
    everybody's been telling me that too: null
    everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days,: null
    everyone, everyone had houses like that.: null
    example, this summer I, I was about fifteen pounds heavier than I wanted to be: null
    exercise is, is strongly considered one of them.: null
    first it was stress, then it went to cholesterol,: null
    for a long time my husband didn't want to walk cause he wants to, jog: null
    for about four weeks.: null
    for all I know aerobics started out here.: null
    for her, she can't run in the morning.: null
    for us it was educational as well as exercise beneficial.: null
    from institutes of learning like that, I know that they've got to get their money somewhere,: null
    from there just,: null
    from when I've done it, it does give you a good, a real good workout.: null
    generally, I can, I can get in and get a program,: null
    get your girlfriend to work out with you.: null
    getting out and being active, is, helps out.: null
    getting to see the same women every: null
    good luck on your graduation and your ...: null

    he didn't think it looked predawn to him.: null
    he does it every day like a ritual.: null
    he doesn't have to do anything.: null
    he don't, he don't gain it like I do.: null

    her ankles couldn't take it anymore.: null
    her ankles will start hurting again and stuff. Even if she does get on flat ground,: null

    how I met him was through, the aerobics class that he used to teach.: null
    i, it's, it's at least something.: null
    i, it, just that's how it affected him.: null
    if I do it, okay,: null
    if I do sit ups, I'll throw a, a towel down or something.: null
    if I have a lunch hour with nice weather I get out and, and walk.: null
    if I have something, some team sport or some activity, then it's kind of like having fun,: null
    if I walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me.: null
    if I were you, I would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while.: null
    if I, if I skipped it then it kind of threw the, the whole, the whole system out of whack.: null
    if it gets longer than that I, I, i, it, I start not doing anything.: null
    if it's exercise, it's a task.: null
    if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity, I don't mind: null
    if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late, they kind of wait on us.: null
    if you did football, the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you: null

    in fact, I lived there until nineteen, late nineteen fifties.: null
    ? in fact, he, everyone there was a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection
      Agency, who did work back in nineteen eightysix, who wrote a letter to Dr. Price
      in nineteen eightyseven. in this letter he praised Dr. Price for the work he
      did back in the sixties on this and said that E P A had been doing experiments
      on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis.
    : null
    in fact, our one little block and a half there, four houses sold last summer: null
    in fact, the T Ier's families can come in on these things,: null
    in general I like to exer, I, I like dance a lot,: null
    in nineteenthree they started experimenting with chlorinating the water. In nineteenthirteen most of the major cities,: null
    ? in the last couple of months I've changed to a new residence and everything
      has gotten kind of turned a little upside down.
    : null
    in the rain, I love to run in the rain,: null
    in the winter it gets pretty cold.: null
    in urban California it's just,: null
    in, in summer I like to swim.: null
    in, in, in the winter, you, typically it's, it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis.: null
    instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there,: null
    ironically enough I'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because I resumed an aerobics class the night before last.: null
    is one or two timer a year if I do go on them: null
    it became part of the package,: null
    it can be a pain.: null
    it cost sixty dollars,: null
    it didn't get the upper part of my body,: null
    it doesn't cost anything .: null
    it doesn't deal with just exercise, or just stress management, or just diet, or anything.: null
    it doesn't,: null
    it felt good,: null
    it gets it down to about forty.: null
    it gives me time to think.: null
    it got kind of dark.: null
    it got real cold for a little while: null
    it got too expensive,: null
    it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth.: null
    it has a, clock radio that also plays c, tapes.: null
    it has been a while since I have done that.: null
    it has helped a lot: null
    it has no effect on me.: null
    it involves,: null
    it is an hour.: null
    it is hard to get my attitude to, to get myself up there.: null
    it is hard.: null
    it is in the building: null
    it is like an exercise in itself,: null
    it is like double strenuous.: null
    it is like twentyfour dollars every six weeks.: null
    it is like, I, I lift weights with about the same curl weight as I do the squats with.: null
    it is really amazing how fast the inches come off,: null
    it is really making me want to exercise: null
    it is, it's a really beautiful area.: null
    it just became such a pain.: null
    it just wore me out.: null
    it keeps me going.: null
    it kind of kills the evening for doing errands.: null
    it looked darker to him, because he, he was in the house with the lights on.: null
    it makes me feel better.: null
    it matches one if I have one on the other side.: null
    it puts those little wrinkles around your lips.: null
    it really does.: null
    it really is.: null
    it sounded like, that they skied really well, and when they are actually talking about a place.: null
    it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because I do it all the time,: null
    it tapers off .: null
    it tells it: null
    it tells you: null
    it took me about a year of arguing,: null
    it was a lot of sweat: null
    it was a regular,: null
    it was a two story.: null
    it was about four inches deep and then about, oh a seventy degree angle.: null
    it was burnt out about two years ago: null
    it was not applicable to me: null
    it was pretty tough,: null
    it was real nice outside,: null
    it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming: null
    it was really helpful at the time.: null
    it was running three nights a week.: null
    it was so difficult to go on a regular basis, to drive the distance you have to go.: null
    it was, it was kind of hilly: null
    it was, it's less than what you pay now for going in there,: null
    it was, this way we didn't have to layoff an active person: null
    it wasn't near me.: null
    it wasn't really health related.: null
    it wasn't the trumpet .: null
    it went up to, I don't know, nine or ten.: null
    it will bother me.: null
    it would depend upon which one you want.: null
    it would last about a couple of weeks: null
    it would only take three or four days: null
    it's a daily thing for her.: null
    it's a foam thing,: null
    it's a forty year old house,: null
    it's a hour long video,: null
    it's a lot of fun: null
    it's a lot.: null
    it's a very small book: null
    it's a, an aerobic video with, not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down,: null
    it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning.: null
    it's about eight dollars a month.: null
    it's about half way between the Spring Creek and the, the Dallas site.: null
    it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in sh, in there,: null
    it's along the lines,: null
    it's amazing how much better I feel.: null
    it's amazing what he points out in that book: null
    it's amazing,: null
    it's amazing, that, prior to nineteentwenty there were very few heart attacks.: null
    it's an hour straight.: null
    it's an old concrete pool.: null
    it's at home, I can, I can do some of my reading,: null
    it's because I exercise: null
    it's been fun,: null
    it's been raining a lot this spring,: null
    it's called a center: null
    it's changed places .: null
    it's collecting dust right now.: null
    it's definitely a task.: null
    it's for your abdominals: null
    it's four nights a week.: null
    it's got a lot, pages and pages.: null
    it's got all the rides coming up,: null
    it's got, it's got a rounded front on it.: null
    it's great.: null
    it's had that orientation for quite some time.: null
    ? it's hard to find, an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, because I
      know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes
    : null
    it's hard to find.: null
    it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise.: null
    it's just a, it's just a chore,: null
    it's just as boring.: null
    it's just dispensed with these distinctions.: null
    it's just kind of nice, and especially when I have my cat that comes down and joins me.: null
    it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to.: null
    it's just to get motivated to do it,: null
    it's just, it's a lot of fun.: null
    it's just, it's along the Erie Canal up here.: null
    it's just, it's an automatic high for her.: null
    it's just, it's, it's not a question of whether I want to,: null
    it's kind of another day out for her: null
    it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now, because, when I'm not fat like I used to be: null
    it's kind of nice.: null
    it's less expensive.: null
    it's like feeding little babies food and telling them it's something else so that they'll eat it.: null
    it's like when I got laid off,: null
    it's like, Heavenly.: null
    it's mostly indoor sports, I think, in the winter.: null
    it's no big deal.: null
    it's not President's any more.: null
    it's not a, a structured sort of thing,: null
    it's not anything I would want to,: null
    it's not as bad as I thought it would be,: null
    it's not really a group where you chat a lot.: null
    it's not that far of a drive: null
    it's not to where I'm just so freed up that I, I just go, this is wonderful,: null
    it's not you can do the class anytime you want,: null
    it's not, it's not excessively crowded on the weekends.: null
    it's only thirty minutes: null
    it's probably because I, I, I was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California,: null
    it's real challenging,: null
    it's really a: null
    ? it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because
      what I'm finding is that if they do offer it, you get the crowd of women that
      are, ,
    : null
    it's really, it's an aerobic routine.: null
    it's really, it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff,: null
    it's right here.: null
    it's right there,: null
    it's so hard for me.: null
    it's sort of like an aerobics class: null
    it's strange that you can do, like I did aerobics, all the time: null
    it's such a chor, it's such a trouble here.: null
    it's supposed to burn off more calories: null
    it's the geriatric crowd.: null
    it's the other way around.: null
    it's this maintaining a, a regular habit that I just can't: null
    it's with dance steps.: null
    it's your choice where you want to go,: null
    it's, I don't exercise as much as I'd like.: null
    it's, it is very nice.: null
    it's, it's a lot of fun,: null
    it's, it's a opportunity to stay alive really.: null
    it's, it's a pretty nice setup.: null
    it's, it's enough of a pain, that I did it consistently one year,: null
    it's, it's just about six feet long, rolls up: null
    it's, it's just, I'm busy.: null
    it's, it's more regulated,: null
    it's, it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path ,: null
    it's, it's over on the other end.: null
    it's, it's, it's a good ride: null
    it's, it's, it's, it's new,: null
    it's, they have a really nice facility at the T I.: null
    it, it creates a problem, when you're on the road.: null
    ? it, it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery
      disease which is, low cardiovascular fitness, and also, the cholesterol.
    : null
    it, it makes you do it.: null
    it, it started about yesterday, I believe.: null
    it, it's it's really coming around.: null
    it, it's not real dangerous,: null
    it, they call it a low impact aerobics,: null
    just I do sit ups sometimes before I go to bed or when I wake up,: null
    just I've never used those machines: null
    just aerobic activity: null
    just close to Methodist Hospital.: null
    just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife,: null
    just in general, I sleep a lot better: null
    just like everything else, I was real gung ho with a friend of mine,: null
    just the fact that I can go straight from my desk over to the, the recreation center and do it helps a lot.: null
    just, be careful not to slide.: null
    kids enjoy that and and all.: null
    last semester I had stopped working out 'cause I hurt myself and started smoking a lot,: null
    last summer I was a, a swim instructor all summer and, and life guard,: null
    last year I would, I did it every day,: null
    last year I'm, belong to a club right here.: null
    last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class.: null
    lately, there's been nights that I could have gone: null
    like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a, a program.: null
    like I say, I just do it at night,: null
    like I say, it ain't as bad this time, because I was in shape when I got pregnant.: null
    like I say, you just, I'd rather do that than watch television anyhow: null
    like I'll be really tired,: null
    ? like this orthopedist said, he said you'd be surprised how many basket, how
      many people come in here with things like that because they are active.

    little TEXAS BICYCLIST, is a little newspaper that comes out every month.: null
    luckily at there's a little more diverse clientele.: null
    maybe it isn't in Utah.: null
    me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play: null
    me and the insurance adjusters are, are very familiar with each other: null
    me, I'm going, and my daughter Janet in Austin.: null
    mine are older now, doing, their own things: null
    most of my friends that are my age don't exercise: null
    most of the guys were all in one class: null
    most of the time I enjoy it.: null
    most of the training I've got has been through Dallas just teaching E S L.: null
    most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore.: null
    most, most, mo, sort of modern looking restaurants will,: null
    moving up, I run: null
    much less than what I need to.: null
    my body was, was, was tuned into that, that mode,: null
    my daughter lives in Arlington,: null
    my daughter's playing the piano: null
    my don't get very much use .: null
    my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising.: null
    my exercise program consists of,: null
    my fingers exercise more than anything now.: null
    my husband and I take, ten mile walks, as often as possible.: null
    my husband and I, we have entered a few rallies, that's pretty popular in Texas,: null
    my husband being a T I engineer,: null
    my husband goes a lot: null
    my husband had a lot of heartburn with that.: null
    my husband never was either until he lost the weight.: null
    my husband said he's never joined a course, right.: null
    my husband still works there,: null
    my husband swims every day at lunch, which he loves doing: null
    my husband used to work out three days a week with, at the Texas Instruments gym.: null
    my husband was just running out the door,: null
    my husband's just discouraged me on those things.: null
    my husband's working over there: null
    my kids, luckily, are old enough I can leave them at home alone while I go out and walk.: null
    my outside activities have been curtailed a lot.: null
    my parents have a treadmill: null
    my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment: null
    my step classes and toning is about the only thing: null
    my teacher looked at it every week,: null
    my treadmill has an incline: null
    my wife and I kind of take turns.: null
    my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it,: null
    my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself: null
    my wife would just love that.: null
    my, my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class.: null
    never having lived in Texas before I starting working for T I: null
    no matter what I did or how I did it, I invariably got myself wet.: null
    no matter what the weather is they can walk: null
    not every morning, it probably averages about two days a week: null
    not my kneecap.: null
    not on the nights that I do aerobics,: null
    not with the sense that it was, chore or something that I was having to do,: null
    nothing's real regular about this because I have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule,: null
    now I do not have a club: null
    ? now I notice that this, in this small city that I live in, they do have a, a
      gym that just opened up here about a month ago.
    : null
    now I weigh only about one, about one seventyfive.: null
    now I work out at home, because I don't really, my schedule with school and work, I don't have time to get down to one.: null
    now I'm down to about four: null
    now I'm fiftyfive.: null
    now if I haven't done it in a day or two or something, I really notice that I haven't done it in a ...: null
    now it's kind of like,: null
    now they have those, those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for toning instead of using a weight,: null
    now they're saying what's cholesterol,: null
    now, I'm in college: null
    of course another hour to get back home.: null
    of course it's real convenient, because it is right there at work.: null
    of course while I'm doing it I feel pretty good,: null
    of course, I could lose, lose certainly: null
    of course, it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for that opportunity.: null
    of course, she needs walking: null
    off and on,: null
    off and on.: null
    often, when I get around to doing it, then I, I feel better when I get back to work: null
    on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I run two miles.: null
    once I get into it and I, if I, if I get into better shape then it'll be, it won't be as much of a, a chore to me.: null
    once I get started, and, and, I, I, I ca, I do it every night.: null
    once I got used to it, it was habit forming.: null
    once he got motivated, now he's ready to walk every night.: null
    one day I do the aerobics.: null
    one day I walk: null
    one night I talked to these two guys, one night I talked to one guy: null
    one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and,: null
    one semester I thought, okay, that's what I'm going to do: null
    one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics: null
    one week, .: null
    other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here.: null
    others of them, had an impact on the society around here.: null
    our dog has lost a little weight.: null
    our parking lot's in one end of the, of the campus: null
    our pool is not, is not heated: null
    our schedules don't coincide as well as they used to,: null
    our street is an awful lot of retired people,: null
    ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big, I guess, it's twentyeight by fifteen front porch.: null
    out near my house is pretty hilly.: null
    painting, lawn, gutters.: null
    part of my problem is I have small children,: null
    people are always saying to me, how do you stay thin: null
    people are more sympathetic to it.: null
    people have told me.: null
    people will walk around the mall.: null
    physically, I mean: null
    plus there's a build up of stress: null
    pretty much.: null
    pretty soon, here she comes.: null
    pretty, but,: null
    prone type things, where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing,: null
    putting two of us through, isn't he lucky.: null
    right downstairs there's a facility.: null
    right now I'm just a little over about a mile and a half,: null
    right now I'm on two teams: null
    right now my exercise is pretty much limited to, softball league and occasional ride on the bike,: null
    right now, I try when it's nice out,: null
    running, I, I'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated: null
    see a little bit of Texas I've never seen before.: null
    seems to be to easy to get busy with other things.: null
    seen that my, my have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbor's fence.: null
    she came to our school twice a week.: null
    she can be upstairs in the bedroom,: null
    she could find out if she wanted to go.: null
    she could, a little bit.: null
    she didn't have,: null
    she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore.: null
    she doesn't want me to walk,: null
    she doesn't want to be out by herself anywhere in Dallas.: null
    she had a small waist: null
    she had injured her back and needed a walking partner: null
    she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire, I think.: null
    she has started doing that rather than rather than take off.: null
    she is not around.: null
    she just hasn't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape.: null
    she just loves it.: null
    she lasted about two weeks,: null
    she looked so good,: null
    she loves it.: null
    she may be keeping that on purpose,: null
    she runs all the time,: null
    she said, go for the swimming pool.: null
    she said, that's while it's healing, you're going to mess it up,: null
    ? she said, the most conservative approach, you do the medicine, you do the medicine
      again and again, before you think of surgery.
    : null
    she saw it on the computer screen: null
    she started running down there and all the hills.: null
    she walks around, talks to people: null
    she was about eighty: null
    she was delivered the next day.: null
    she was standing just as straight and tall: null
    she was, hey,: null
    she was, she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else: null
    she would push,: null
    she wouldn't take no for an answer .: null
    she'd kind of lay it on occasionally, .: null
    she's a wonderful woman: null
    she's about nine months now, though.: null
    she's been walking quite a bit,: null
    she's in college.: null
    she's kind of in the same mode.: null
    she's, it, she's good.: null
    shoot it's only about ten bucks a month.: null
    since I am not a tennis player, I don't get that,: null
    since I worked at a recreation center I could, use those facilities quite often.: null
    since the first of the year neither one of us have been going.: null
    so far it hasn't happened,: null
    some days he doesn't,: null
    some health related thing is going to blow me away.: null
    some of the prizes are pretty nice.: null
    some of them are real short: null
    some of them fizzled out: null
    some of them were disastrous: null
    ? some, some of the people, some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown
      too, are picking up some of those great big houses,
    : null
    somebody sold it in a garage sale,: null
    somebody's got to be willing to pay for it, and believe in it,: null
    someone else is telling me, okay, let's move this way, let's move that way,: null
    something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable.: null
    sometime when I ask, I just feel like, boy, am I stupid or what.: null
    sometimes I bike to work which is about, a fifteen mile trip each way.: null
    sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot short, mentality to save a few bucks.: null
    sometimes it's my kids.: null
    sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle.: null
    sometimes she just flops them all over the seat.: null
    sometimes they don't.: null
    still I was so sore: null
    still there are, there are other people there doing the, doing the same thing.: null
    still young, getting older.: null
    still, I don't like to go alone.: null
    still, I want to get up early in the morning and walk.: null
    still, it was pretty high impact stuff, .: null
    story and a half, really, because we had a basement.: null
    stuff like that.: null
    swimming is a, is a part that I, I'd like to get into as far as my ,: null
    that I'm need to do this, that and the other: null
    that beats any offer I've heard in a long time.: null
    that does look very odd in the water.: null
    that doesn't mean it gets done.: null
    that gets old too in a very short order,: null
    that gives me plenty of exercise,: null
    that has made me,: null
    that helped me, helped motivate me .: null
    that helps, pass the time.: null
    that is a little less trau, burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her.: null
    that is about it .: null
    that is one of the things that they really stressed doing,: null
    that is something that I am motivated about now because I do need to get myself feeling better: null
    that is the big difference: null
    that is the most incredible aerobic workout I have ever done.: null
    ? that is why, I was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing
      what different exercises they could get me on to, get out of the routine.
    : null
    that is, I have started doing more push ups: null
    that it is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it any time of the year.: null
    that just kind of gets myself, gets me, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess.: null
    that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that.: null
    that one was.: null
    that pays also.: null
    that somehow takes,: null
    that sounds, you sound just like my husband.: null
    that takes about, really about, maybe about thirteen minutes,: null
    that was back,: null
    that was four and a half hours a week.: null
    that was really tough .: null
    that was the one place where I was also able to do weight training,: null
    that was the only reason I quit.: null
    that was the only time I have ever been able to start an exercise program and really stick to it,: null
    that was two weeks I had missed,: null
    that was very helpful: null
    that was when they had,: null
    that way I get the little extra exercise.: null
    that's Nevada to California: null
    that's a hard question to answer because I do physical things, but I don't always set out for them to be exercise.: null
    that's a lot of, part of it.: null
    that's about it.: null
    that's all I do, too.: null
    that's always been the way that I have kept myself in, the shape that I was satisfied with at least.: null
    that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did.: null
    that's going to start soon again: null
    that's hard,: null
    that's it, that's about where almost all of the fat comes from: null
    that's kind of a motivator,: null
    that's mostly flat.: null
    that's my favorite way to exercise.: null
    that's neat.: null
    that's no fun.: null
    that's not bad.: null
    that's not really beneficial,: null
    that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way,: null
    that's not why I got it,: null
    that's one of the frustrating things cause I can find very few people to go with me: null
    that's one thing I like about the Spring Creek place.: null
    that's pretty good.: null
    that's really a terrific feeling, because you just go there at the end of the day, and you figure, I'm ready for bed: null
    that's the longest I've ever ridden so far,: null
    that's the only place I haven't tried: null
    that's the other reason,: null
    that's the way I am.: null
    that's the way my mother stands on it.: null
    that's the way ours is.: null
    that's thought,: null
    ? that's true, when I go home from work at the end of the day, if I go up for
      an hour in the pool, I'm much, much more awake,
    : null
    that's what I do for ,: null
    that's what I do.: null
    that's what I like to do.: null
    that's what he does,: null
    that's what my friend did.: null
    that's where I actually get my exercise,: null
    that's why I've kept active in that way.: null
    that's, that's about the extent of it.: null
    that's, that's where I'm really starting to get noticeable,: null
    that, that during that time the stress from the day goes away.: null
    the Spring Creek one is a lot more modern, has a lot more niceties, amenities: null
    the T I rec center has an aerobics program for, for, prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing.: null
    the V I P gives you, gives you a diet, a computerized diet.: null
    the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership,: null
    the amount varies: null
    the answer's: null
    the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around.: null
    the doctor has had me on medication,: null
    the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore,: null
    the doctor said, you didn't do anything.: null
    the emergency room was like a bad comedy show .: null
    the ex, the, weight lifting on the other hand is actually,: null
    the first one I joined, they went out of business: null
    the guy moved in and completely redid: null
    the guy that built it was weird,: null
    the guys very opinionated,: null
    the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment.: null
    the last little while, for one reason or another, we haven't been real consistent.: null
    ? the main, the main thing, I guess, for me is just to enjoy it because once it
      starts seeming like, exercise and a chore , I'll lay off it more.
    : null
    the more they tried to get my foot in the more I screamed,: null
    the muscle builds: null
    the neighbor across the street, she goes, belongs to President's,: null
    the next semester they were required to do weight lifting.: null
    the only exercise program I'm doing right now is walking.: null
    the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet.: null
    the other two nights a week my husband worked,: null
    the people are great.: null
    the pool when it gets warmer.: null
    the prizes are pretty nice.: null
    the problem is that I am so tired at the end of the day,: null
    the question was about, physical fitness and staying in shape and exercise.: null
    the reason I'm at home is when I had my kids, and I was scheduled to go back and I had been rated number one in the field: null
    the research that I've done: null
    the rest of me is in pretty good shape: null
    the school, the buildings are all at the other end,: null
    the second time I was going to do it at Richland College,: null
    the shock on the system is, is just too much,: null
    the street doesn't go anywhere.: null
    the sweat had built up on me and built up under my skin and caused me to peel.: null
    the two dissimilar floor lev, floor coverings were not level.: null
    the two miles, went fairly quickly.: null
    the water only comes up basically to your, anywhere from your waist to your, chest, I'd say.: null
    the weather is nice except for when it rains,: null
    the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you.: null
    the, the more upper body strength, the easier it is to play.: null
    ? the, the, the uni, University of California at Berkeley puts out THE WELLNESS
      LETTER. Which is, turned into a fairly well subscribed to, newsletter,
    : null
    then I do about,: null
    then I had pulled a muscle in my knee.: null
    then I have given that up,: null
    then I started school again,: null
    then I would do them two times a day,: null
    then I would wear myself out .: null
    then I'll get tired of doing that,: null
    then forget that,: null
    then it doesn't bother me very much.: null
    then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run.: null
    then on the letter it says cash or prize.: null
    then she could go if she were interested.: null
    then she had to get back to work and which was traveling to New York: null
    then that was back when, the high impact and,: null
    then tonight I got into a, a,: null
    then we do stretching: null
    then you could go either one,: null
    there are a group of teachers,: null
    there are other people around that,: null
    there are some parts during that exercise that I think, I cannot do another: null
    there are these stationery bikes that you just ride: null
    there are, there are lots of bike paths.: null
    there aren't many people, that want to do that.: null
    there is Texas Industries and different things.: null
    there is motivation around there: null
    there is, girl that went through our school district,: null
    there was four of us together.: null
    there was my ego when I went ahead: null
    there was no exercise.: null
    there was some girl there.: null
    there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block.: null

    things have become much more enlightened since then.: null
    thirty minutes was definitely plenty.: null

    this has worked out real nicely.: null
    this is five hundred.: null
    this is my exercise time: null
    this is my first time to do it.: null
    this is one of those things,: null
    this is really a stupid thing that happened,: null
    this is the first call I've done,: null
    this is the first time I've done it.: null
    this is the last week.: null
    this many minutes you get a B,: null
    this only goes up to F.: null
    this past couple months have been really hectic: null
    this semester, I'll tell you what, I, it's been almost impossible for me to get, back to regular exercise.: null
    this session is about to run out.: null
    this time of year, you can't get much biking in.: null
    this was just, I guess, something freak that happened to me,: null
    this weekend I cleaned out some closets: null
    those are going away.: null
    those classes I, I enjoy.: null
    ? thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty
      or forty miles, which that's a lot of fun.
    : null
    three sold the summer before,: null
    to add dependents is, is maybe another dollar or something: null
    to believe some of the things,: null
    to do a whole lot just requires a lot of, coordination as far as: null
    to do, some bicep, tricep exercises.: null
    ? to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without, drawing
      a lot of looks, means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity
    : null
    to stay in condition, I did that, just as a normal: null
    today was pretty,: null
    tonight I only went for thirty minutes,: null
    too bad it's not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby,: null
    try to get some place and exercise from five to six,: null
    two nights a week I was going to school: null
    two years ago, I joined, I joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano.: null
    unless you really like, fish.: null
    until then, I have belonged to exercise clubs: null
    up here , it's only stopped snowing since then.: null
    usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk,: null
    usually most people are just absolutely crippled,: null
    usually the next morning, if you haven't done it in a while, you wake up the next morning: null
    usually, when I go into the hot tub before I go swimming, or when I come out, I'm totally relaxed when I go home.: null
    volleyball,: null
    we are just south of that little bridge, backup on the hill in the trees there,: null
    ? we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter, because really we
      only had about three weeks of snow on the ground.
    : null
    we decided to forget that.: null
    we did do it for a long time,: null

    we try to get out, every, every night.: null
    we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that.: null
    we try to, we used to try to get together,: null
    we very seldom get together to walk: null
    we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house.: null
    we walk our dog every night: null
    we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks: null
    we went to one: null
    we were going to do it,: null
    we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership: null
    we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to.: null
    we will just go out after that.: null
    we'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we couldn't find the place .: null
    we'll go and, and just do what we want to do and then leave.: null
    we'll go to the park: null
    we'll play volleyball: null
    we'll walk up and down the street,: null

    we're talking, fortyfive, fifty minutes for biking,: null
    we're within walking distance of, of stores and shops: null
    we've been walking every morning at, going: null
    we've decided to maintain our weight, that we will do this exercise walking program: null
    we've got a one story house now: null
    we've had a few of the health fairs up here: null
    we've, just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment.: null
    we, I guess I went to a small Baptist school: null
    we, I have two friends, that we walk.: null
    we, exercise.: null
    we, we can change right there in the building.: null
    we, we, take it seriously.: null
    we, wearing that I haven't had any problems in the past year or so.: null
    we, when we go, we have about, do about fifteen miles a week,: null
    what I did was I went to a jazzercise class in a new location in Richardson near where we live in North Dallas,: null
    what I do, is I bowl.: null
    what I like to do is I like to stretch out: null
    what I'm telling you isn't something you go out and do: null
    what happened about couple of weeks ago I started again.: null
    what was the other one, I think was, obesity.: null
    when I became pregnant I also got meningitis,: null
    when I came down I hit with my full weight on my foot, but on concrete.: null
    when I can, I like to ride my regular bike outside, because it's so much nicer.: null
    when I do those things, they're boring.: null
    when I first started, it, that was the hardest thing was: null
    when I go to visit her, I love to get out on that bike trail, and ride the bike,: null
    when I go visit them, I get on that thing every now and then.: null
    ? when I got married and had children and everything, it seems like I keep all
      my activity just chasing around fulfilling my obligations
    : null
    when I graduated I haven't done much.: null
    when I walk I'll take along a radio or something: null
    when I was going to,: null
    when I was in high school we had a choice of, taking, physical education courses on exercise,: null
    when I was playing ball we could run all day and not be tired, .: null
    when I was working there I was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry ,: null
    when I went to physical therapy: null
    when I worked out, I got in pretty good shape.: null
    when it was cold we would go to the mall because you can't take the babies out: null
    when they don't, I, I really notice, how fun it can be when they come.: null
    when they first started it, I, I got all the information, of course,: null
    when we came back they said "Oh, there's a parking space real close," and I parked way out in the boonies,: null
    when we were at this junior college, our coach,: null
    when you come to your Nutri System meeting, don't park in the parking place outside the front door,: null
    when you get into some of these, some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait.: null
    when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height,: null
    when, when I have run and jogged,: null
    where I live in Waco, they do not have anywhere here that is affiliated with President's: null
    with my first little boy, I did gain a lot of weight,: null
    with my wife I actually go to the gym and lift weights, which isn't, I understand, quite exercising,: null
    working out six hours a day, usually six or seven days a week that kind of,: null
    yesterday I started exercising seriously.: null
    yesterday I went to, a spa.: null
    you buy as many classes as you want to at a time: null
    you can actually get a good wo,: null
    you can buy a month's membership.: null
    ? you can d, have variety by putting your feet higher or lower, by putting your
      arms further apart or closer together, by doing them real quick or real slow
    : null
    you can do it with certain, you can do it with weights if you wanted to: null
    you can do that.: null
    you can do with,: null
    you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so,: null
    you can put it up, just in the corner.: null
    you can ride a bike practically all the way to Southern Virginia: null
    you can, I know in the push up, at least, you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up: null
    you don't have the abrasive,: null
    you don't start at this kind of regiment,: null
    you don't think about the pain of it.: null
    you don't work out because you,: null
    you gradually go down again.: null
    you have bands,: null
    you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting, slowly and then working up to, a high heart rate: null
    you have to go in once a week and log your points: null
    you have to have an indoor pool.: null
    you have to, you do have to pay to take them.: null
    you have to.: null
    you have, major, acupuncture schools and things out here.: null
    you just don't see it anywhere else, as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot.: null
    you just go in whenever you can.: null
    you just have to eat at home basically.: null
    you leave out of there: null
    you literally step up on the step and move your arms,: null
    you look very odd in the water,: null
    you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that, above the age of fifteen or something,: null
    you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from, hurting yourself when you play high.: null
    you see these little girls in these little bitty things,: null
    you set a speed on it and the weight: null
    you think about other things.: null
    you were talking about, walking at night and in the morning: null
    you'd probably like the pool there.: null
    you'll get organizations, like institutes for the whole health, or whatever.: null
    you'll hurt yourself .: null
    you're bound to find something you want.: null
    you're bound to.: null
    you're doing it yourself.: null
    you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video: null
    you're like, no,: null
    you're not being double strenuous on your own body.: null
    you're pushing it yourself.: null
    you're talking to someone from California where it's often swimming weather .: null
    you're using weights,: null
    you, you have a step: null
    you, you're, you're struggling against your own body weight: null
    young women,: null
    your ketchup has sugar in it.: null
    your whole body aches,: null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    A lot of women like that.: null
    At first it was just regular aerobics,: null
    At least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could: null
    At least you got a chance to out run them that way.: null
    Better than running.: null
    California gets, tends to be a bit faddish,: null
    Definitely are, are tough classes.: null
    Exercise is not supposed to do that to you.: null
    Goll, times goes fast.: null
    Hot tubs are not, not too bad,: null
    How interesting, I can hardly wait .: null
    I can't use that as an excuse because I didn't do it before: null
    I could never do that I don't think, .: null
    I do silly things like that versus a, a regular program that you would have.: null
    I don't get as much exercise as I used to: null
    I don't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere.: null
    I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries: null
    I feel like I'm out of shape: null
    I find that when you do that, you do more chatting than you do: null
    I found that they, they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on T V.: null
    I guess because they spend all day in back of their desks.: null
    I guess if you care, or if your wife, your future wife, gives you a reason to care: null
    I guess it depends on the person, depends on how motivated you are.: null
    I guess it wouldn't be sand.: null
    I guess my breakdown about, they say about every six months.: null
    I guess that age just starts to catch up to me .: null
    I guess that you don't want to overdo.: null
    I guess that's about the only form,: null
    I guess, sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going.: null
    I had mine either.: null
    I have found really though, I'm kind of the opposite, I'm more active now with him, than I was before,: null
    I have found that with,: null
    I just don't think it's healthy: null
    I just need to, put the old nose to the grindstone,: null
    I just, I'm more into, sitting, than I am ,: null
    I know a lot of people just to be safe,: null
    I mean people seem to get into different aspects.: null
    I need to make myself do that.: null
    I need to start jog something again.: null
    I probably couldn't do that because of my knee .: null
    I probably get more exercise than your average person.: null
    I really loved it,: null
    I still don't think that, they after my experiences that they could, get me to go back, ever again .: null
    ? I think a lot of the times, if you have someone to, work out with, or walk with,
      or something, it does give you that motivation.
    : null
    I think at this point to fit it into, to other things, it's kind of a task.: null
    I think exercise is extremely important: null
    I think having children everything just kind of, everything goes by the wayside.: null
    I think it's a,: null
    I think it's well worth it.: null
    I think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever.: null
    I think parts of it made a lot easier.: null
    I think people are, are more inc,: null
    I think that is just wonderful.: null
    I think that is so wonderful.: null
    I think that it's just is good for your selfesteem, for everything because when you look better, you feel better: null
    I think that keeps a lot, some people from exercising.: null
    I think that's considered exercise whether you want it or not.: null
    I think that's great .: null
    I think that's great.: null
    I think that's really, really good.: null
    I think that's, I think that's a good term, d, demanding the time for yourself.: null
    I think that's, number one problem with everyone .: null
    I think the exercise helped.: null
    I think the last time I was on a bike when I was about twelve,: null
    I think there're so many parts of the District where it's not very safe to get out and walk.: null
    I think this, after you've done it a certain amount of time, it kind of does get to be a routine.: null
    I think we covered it.: null
    I think we've probably know, know each other's exercise habits: null
    I think when we do it ourselves,: null
    I think you do accomplish more after that.: null
    I think you do.: null
    I think you feel better, too, if you get on some program like that,: null
    I think you really have to be disciplined.: null
    I think you really have to, at least twice a week, just to maintain the shape that you're in.: null
    I think, I think that has helped a little bit,: null
    I think, with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that's fun.: null
    I thought, this will be an easy class.: null
    I understand running hurt your shins or knees or something like that.: null
    I understand that walking is suppose to be the, the best exercise.: null
    I'd be afraid, , afraid I probably forgot how to ride a bike,: null
    I'd say, I'd say at twentytwo you don't necessarily need a plan as long as you're getting, getting the exercise otherwise.: null
    I'll go for two weeks and go, this is for the birds,: null
    I'm always afraid they're going to fall over and have a coro, coronary.: null
    I'm kind of like you,: null
    I'm like you,: null
    I'm more aware of it,: null
    I'm sure I don't have near the endurance that I did, .: null
    I'm sure you'd find something.: null
    I've always of that to be, really one of the best forms of exercise,: null
    I've never been,: null
    I've, it's kind of funny.: null
    I, I can say there's a correlation, but I couldn't say which, which caused the other.: null
    I, I just feel like, you have to constantly weigh yourself: null
    I, I presume,: null
    I, I sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city.: null
    I, I, I guess at that point it would turn into a task, ,: null
    I, I, I know, I just know you can't.: null
    I, I, I think it's really important.: null
    I, you could,: null
    If it's hot, you can't do that.: null
    If you are on the street, you better belong there.: null
    ? If you don't have one that's fun, and not enjoy it, look, not acting like she's
      enjoying what she's doing, the class is not going to get out, what they should
      get out of the class.
    : null
    If you don't like to exercise, it isn't going to happen.: null
    If you kind of think of it as a rationale like that, it works out fine.: null
    It curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff.: null
    It does make you feel better.: null
    It is really hard with our life style when you work to,: null
    It is showing up in the weirdest places.: null
    It is so hard.: null
    It keeps going,: null
    It only takes one time.: null
    It seems like you walk quicker.: null
    It was so funny the other day,: null
    It's a hard lesson to learn.: null
    It's a little more convenient,: null
    It's a, it's something you either just really want to do it: null
    It's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise.: null
    It's depressing.: null
    It's good to have a partner.: null
    It's great though,: null
    It's interesting, though.: null
    It's just hard to make yourself go.: null
    It's just some of those women that come up there looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it.: null
    It's kind of funny.: null
    It's more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle.: null
    It's more motivating that way, I think.: null
    It's not hard to stay,: null
    It's probably, I would think it would be hard on your, your legs and your joints and stuff.: null
    It's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up.: null
    It's something,: null
    It's terrible.: null
    It's, it's a new, form I think,: null
    It's, it's really neat.: null
    It's, it's worth the trip.: null
    It's, it's, it's it's frantic, to,: null
    It's, like anything else whether or not you want to: null
    It's, not just exercise, but anything.: null
    Just , you don't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner, .: null
    Just chasing him around the house,: null
    Makes you feel a lot better.: null
    Not everybody has a picture perfect body.: null
    Not just exercise, but,: null
    Of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back.: null
    Of course, sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall: null
    Of course, you got a little different direction going,: null
    One is more of a distance,: null
    Or they're older.: null
    Pretty cheap.: null
    Probably the more you pay, though, the better the machine you have.: null
    Same thing, it repeats, the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen .: null
    So it's a little harder when you're depending on other people to do it with you: null
    Sounds like fun.: null
    Sounds like something I should do.: null
    Suppose to be much better if you find grass, or, or dirt to jog on.: null
    That is a .: null
    That would be really nice .: null
    That you don't do things like that.: null
    That you've just got to: null
    That's a good idea,: null
    That's a plus.: null
    That's a real good,: null
    That's a very common experience.: null
    That's pretty impressive.: null
    That's really good.: null
    That's the way to do it.: null
    That's, motivating.: null
    That's, that's hardcore.: null
    That, that walkabout's a good program.: null
    The average person out on the farm, at least traditionally, {A now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything: null
    The hard thing is getting going.: null
    The irony is, is its people in the cities, in my experience, that are most oriented towards doing the exercise.: null
    The most boring one was about what meal would you cook for a sit down dinner.: null
    The stationary bike is, is so,: null
    The test is a booger.: null
    The, swimming, they say, uses more muscles than any other exercise with,: null
    Then that would,: null
    There you go.: null
    There's no reason that we shouldn't do it,: null
    There's only one crazy out there, to make any difference.: null
    They are real expensive.: null
    They can wait until you get back home.: null
    They do intimidate.: null
    They don't either,: null
    They don't have that perfect look,: null
    They make it as easy as they possibly can for you.: null
    ? They sort of, dev, each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another
      and develop a little bit more, and a little bit more.
    : null
    They tend to tighten up whenever, whenever you have to do something: null
    They're, you ge, they're just made of, I guess it's different kinds of rubber,: null
    They, they seem to think that it, it won't,: null
    Things like that: null
    Those aerobic classes are, are tough the, the high impact.: null
    Those are nice.: null
    We're actually going through the same stages the two year old and the teenager .: null
    When you're young,: null
    When your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a: null
    You can just trust someone else to give you full exercise: null
    You could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the T V: null
    You don't go out when it's twenty some odd degrees,: null
    You don't really have that,: null
    You don't want to lose yourself.: null
    You feel invigorated: null
    You feel very good after you exercise.: null
    You have a good ratio of good to bad.: null
    You have to have the right,: null
    You have to,: null
    You have to.: null
    You owe it to yourself: null
    You still want to eat,: null
    You're a female,: null
    You've kind of gotten out of that little stage there.: null
    a lot of that is diet.: null
    a lot of the, a lot of the myths they've been passing around, people are starting to realize aren't true.: null
    a lot of things do that.: null
    all that pounding all the time.: null
    all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself.: null
    also, the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the relaxation, like saunas, or: null
    an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious.: null
    as long as you're not doing it every day, it's a good ride .: null
    as soon as you do it, it's really a release.: null
    as you get older you will.: null
    at one point it's going to be too late to do it. .: null
    at the time, walking seems to be the best.: null
    basically, the healthier you stay, the longer you'll live.: null
    before long, you, you get this, this whole kind of Gestalt, this whole package of, of health, of health care and options: null
    being twentyseven, you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet: null
    by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late.: null
    certain parts of it.: null
    course it's really,: null
    don't you think a lot of that is diet too?: null
    don't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar.: null
    during, when you're sitting watching T V at night,: null
    early in the mornings and things like that.: null
    especially having a kid, I guess, tends to just gain weight because you have to, to,: null
    especially when somebody's, planning lunch for you and they know what, what's good for you,: null
    especially when you're like us and don't really want to do it anyway.: null
    everything has sugar in it .: null
    everything is within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing .: null
    exercise is so important.: null
    flex time is great.: null
    generally in the Midwest it seems to be less, much less.: null
    hey, you can do what you want.: null
    his assistants usually aren't either.: null
    ? if I spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other
      day doing something for me to make me live longer, then I'll around a lot longer,
    : null
    ? if it was a meditation practice, or if it was, which is similar to a stress
      management practice or alternates to, A M A approved medicine.
    : null
    ? if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning, just like brushing
      your teeth you're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour.
    : null
    if you don't live near there that's not worth,: null
    if you have somebody who will do it with you,: null
    if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, keep the heart rating going,: null
    if you keep working out when you're young though, when you get older, your body's not going to look as bad.: null
    if you're having the pressures of school and, everything else, it's kind of,: null
    if you, if you can make yourself do the tread mill, gosh, that's a good workout.: null
    if, if you know what your routine is, you can do that by yourself,: null
    in bad weather, you'd have to do something inside.: null
    it all depends, for everyone their own what they want to do.: null
    it also builds too much mass if you just,: null
    it does going to start whether you are there or not .: null
    it does really make you feel good,: null
    it doesn't get any better.: null
    it gets worse,: null
    it gets your breathing up: null
    it gives you energy.: null
    it goes all over: null
    it is hard to go regularly for a long time.: null
    it just kind of feeds itself.: null
    it makes biking a better alternative for transportation.: null
    it might not .: null
    it really is, it's worth doing,: null
    it really, from what I understand, it really improves your, cholesterol: null
    it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that you'd be tired,: null
    it takes, it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect.: null
    it would seem to be real beneficial.: null
    it's a big commitment.: null
    it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is.: null
    it's a lot more fun than some other things I could do, I guess.: null
    it's a thought.: null
    it's all the same to me.: null
    it's another thing to, to already be past that and then not be able to because of your health.: null
    it's been too nice all weekend.: null
    it's boring .: null
    it's curious, I don't know why, don't know if it's,: null
    it's dangerous.: null
    it's fairly picturesque.: null
    it's great afterwards,: null
    it's hard on women.: null
    it's interesting, because there are re, real regional differences.: null
    it's just a put off.: null
    it's just because you're smart.: null
    it's just so much weight lifting.: null
    it's kind of a waste of money if you don't take advantage of it.: null
    it's like low impact aerobics: null
    it's like low impact aerobics, just: null
    it's misery loves company.: null
    it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't, you don't have any excuse.: null
    it's nice to do it together, too, I guess.: null
    it's not as boring if you get several people: null
    it's not just because you are in Oak Cliff,: null
    it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming,: null
    it's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going.: null
    it's once you get out of that habit: null
    it's pretty small.: null
    it's real hard on your legs: null
    ? it's really hard to find something that works, and, to find time to do it and
      stay committed to it three days a week or whatever.
    : null
    it's really weird,: null
    it's silly not to,: null
    it's so aggravating to to have an injury like that.: null
    it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people.: null
    it's structured like that,: null
    it's terribly boring,: null
    it's too cold.: null
    it's too dangerous.: null
    it's too nice,: null
    it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too.: null
    it's, I think it just benefits you all around.: null
    it's, afterwards,: null
    it's, it does a lot for you I think.: null
    it's, it's always a chore.: null
    it's, it's just, I don't know, it's, it's a total free relaxation.: null
    it's, it's rough: null
    it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete,: null
    it's, it's, it's aero, it's similar to aerobics with weights: null
    it's, it's, it's, it's pretty good.: null
    it's, it, it's something you can all,: null
    it, it is like dance,: null
    it, it just gets worse.: null
    it, it just makes stuff move down.: null
    it, it makes it pass pretty quickly,: null
    it, it works everything: null
    it, it's not that great,: null
    it, it's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise,: null
    it, it's, it's changing to a degree,: null
    it, it, it's always trade offs,: null
    it, your body just gets used to it.: null
    may be not safe going to the parking garage .: null
    maybe it's because of the winters.: null
    maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being.: null
    more about this stuff than I do, obviously then,: null
    more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things,: null
    most of the health clubs: null
    most of the others to me are very dull.: null
    nice way to start off this spring.: null
    no big deal one way or the other.: null
    no big deal.: null
    no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing.: null
    now bench or step aerobics have: null
    of course in the cities,: null
    once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape: null
    once you start getting into that, one, you just feel good: null
    one of the ones that had an impact was, people becoming interested in alternate practices,: null
    one's more, just,: null
    only thing I'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees: null
    other than that I just, I kind of get in the mood every once in awhile, say,: null
    over thirtyfive everything goes downhill .: null
    part of it is California,: null
    ? people from California seem to be more health motivated all around. as far as
      the diet, and everything. the diet and, just your health consciousness,
    : null
    people that live for it and, eat a bunch of different pills, and,: null
    perhaps, it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun, or something like that.: null
    perky is a good word for it: null
    really have a lot of variety.: null
    right after you get out.: null
    running and jogging and just not going anywhere is just,: null
    smoking ages you quick,: null
    some people are a little bit fanatical about it.: null
    something else has to go away: null
    sometimes I feel like I'm in a singles bar .: null
    sometimes if you get a little soreness you feel like, I've done a good job because I got, worked myself to that point.: null
    sounds good.: null
    that can be awful.: null
    that could,: null
    that gives you, lots of exercise.: null
    that is a little less,: null
    that is just too long.: null
    that is sort of weird, because you, you, are not going anywhere: null
    that is, that is a pretty good clip: null
    that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing.: null
    that sounds like something good to do then.: null
    that was a lot of fun: null
    that was wild .: null
    that will get me where I'll have to do it,: null
    that would be cool sometime if I could, work up to that.: null
    that would keep you going.: null
    that's a thought.: null
    that's not quite so ,: null
    that's probably something that, that you could do,: null
    that's real good.: null
    that's something that comes with time, too.: null
    that's the hard decision, is, okay, if I'm going to run in the mornings, what am I, what do I trade it off for.: null
    that's the, that's the in thing.: null
    that's, that's enough.: null
    that's, that's good as far as the cal,: null
    that's, that's th, really good: null
    the aerobics isn't too boring.: null
    the more money they put into it.: null
    the object,: null
    the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit.: null
    the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show, at least on .: null
    the water takes the resistance.: null
    the, the, some of the Nautilus equipment that I started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting,: null
    then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up,: null
    then you should: null
    there are some people,: null
    there are things I should do.: null
    there must be something to some of them.: null
    there was a point to it,: null
    there's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you don't have to strain yourself or sweat: null
    there's always an excuse,: null
    there's no big deal all the way around,: null
    there's really bad for you.: null
    there, there's no, no question the, the end result is great: null
    they don't have the hard body.: null
    they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued.: null
    they must have been asking.: null
    they really don't help you a whole lot.: null
    they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging.: null
    they seem pretty,: null
    they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour.: null
    they're ...: null
    they're all like twentyone years of age .: null
    they're pretty.: null
    they, they live to a hundred and ten some ,: null
    they, they, they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups,: null
    those kind of things age you more.: null
    ? those people that I'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now,
      get the enjoyment of me, years past where I would have been if I wouldn't have
      taken it.
    : null
    to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there,: null
    to think that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is, is just hard to believe.: null
    unless you do something like that, y, you're going to get sick.: null
    walking is kind of boring.: null
    we take the easy way sometimes.: null
    what I found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself.: null
    ? what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle between, when you,
      when you add something to your life, when you add a plan to your life,
    : null
    when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children.: null
    when you get out of shape and you don't,: null
    when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems, you get blown away.: null
    when you want to do it, it's really, really aggravating.: null
    winters are kind of a problem: null
    within reason, you can lose weight or maintain your weight: null
    would that we could .: null
    you actually: null
    you are just kind of going Ugh.: null
    you can also, you can, pretty much do it privately if you had your own private, sort of contest.: null
    you can do it anywhere.: null
    you can do it whenever you want I guess.: null
    you can do it, wherever you're at: null
    you can eat anything you want, drink anything you want,: null
    you can gain too much weight.: null
    you can get a really good workout on it.: null
    you can kind of talk,: null
    you can recover.: null
    you can relax that way,: null
    you can use what ever rationale you want,: null
    you can't forget how to ride a bike.: null
    you can't talk anyone into it.: null
    you could have them around long enough: null
    you don't get the soreness.: null
    you don't have time or something like that.: null
    you don't like to see how you work.: null
    you feel so much better,: null
    you get to meet different people,: null
    you get, an influx of a lot of people from all over the country,: null
    you have the music, and someone, like you said, someone else is counting,: null
    you just have to stick with it.: null
    you know it's got to be good for you.: null
    ? you know it, it doesn't, doesn't, accustom your legs to the kind of strength
      that you have when you are running for a long time.
    : null
    you look a whole lot better.: null
    you never know.: null
    you obviously are, are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it.: null
    you probably do.: null
    you probably wouldn't.: null
    you see a lot of, mostly older people though that, walk in the malls.: null
    you seemed to have s, solved that problem without any, any external: null
    you watch it'll be exactly the same .: null
    you would think.: null
    you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up,: null
    you'll come,: null
    you're amazed at how much that adds up.: null
    you're easily tired: null
    you're getting into even more interesting stages.: null
    you're lucky then: null
    you're lucky.: null
    you're not missing anything at the Dallas renovated site.: null
    you're ready to go at a,: null
    you're still young.: null
    you're, I guess you're not as dedicated if you don't drive over to do it.: null
    you're, you are so far ahead of me.: null
    you, not only, you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit, but you're probably prolonging your life.: null
    you, then you get some of the, good exercise and some of the desired results,: null
    you, you're doing it for fun.: null

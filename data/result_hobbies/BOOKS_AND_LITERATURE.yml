    just light reading that are,: null
    just like s, some, one quote that he had was that he thought the America's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle,: null
    kind of off the wall.: null
    lately, I've been, on the whole, very practical,: null
    like I said, I do not keep up on all that.: null
    like by Steinbeck.: null
    like, I like, Richard Broudigan a lot.: null
    lot of them related to, business and financial matters since that's what I do for a living.: null
    mainly I am a front page person.: null
    maybe I am into some things occasionally that I don't think of in terms of self improvement.: null
    maybe I will.: null

    not more of a radio buff: null
    ? not only am, am I re, reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed,
      but also, because the board of advisers for this, journal doesn't have, right
      now doesn't have a really respected name, who's a, a scholar on, on music,
    : null
    not to say I wouldn't,: null

    outside of those kind of things, you know, the other thing that I've really gotten into reading,: null
    over there on the Texas border you had a lot of, of groups heading for Mexico: null

      health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking,
    : null
    sometimes I just can't wait that long,: null
    sometimes biogr,: null
    starts out when they're small and continues through generations: null
    supposedly this guy had, had been breaking there for awhi,: null
    th, that's why I like to read SPORTS ILLUSTRATED so much: null
    th, they were kind of expensive.: null
    that didn't go s, over,: null
    that has a little bit to do with some of the things that I read .: null
    that is like I said. I I do not watch much T V any more either.: null
    that is pretty much for right now,: null
    that is the best book to go through, those NATIONAL: null
    that is what I have heard.: null
    that is when it really got big.: null
    that one was good.: null
    that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that,: null
    that was PRESUMED INNOCENT.: null
    that was actually after the war was over: null
    that was another one.: null
    that was excellent.: null
    that was helpful to us.: null

    that was real good.: null
    that was their main, main money making,: null
    that was very helpful to me as far as books.: null
    that's a good one.: null
    that's about it, because otherwise I'm reading so much for school.: null
    that's about, archaeology: null
    that's an alternate means of dealing with ,: null
    that's been another one that I've thought was real helpful. other than that, my reading centers on PADDINGTON BEAR,: null
    that's computer stuff.: null
    that's exactly what I was going to say.: null
    that's good.: null
    that's interesting.: null
    that's it's really and truly: null
    that's just where my heart is: null
    that's right now, right now pretty much what I'm doing as far as,: null
    that's that.: null
    that's the last thing I, I've read,: null
    that's the one I was thinking of.: null
    that's the other problem I have.: null
    that's what I do too.: null
    that's what made me want to read the book.: null
    that's when I had the subscription.: null
    that's where my folks all came from.: null
    that's, that's a bummer.: null
    ? the SHADOW OF BLOOMING GROVE and TWO THOUSAND AND TEN and GRANT TAKES COMMAND
      and THE WAR IN THE YEAR , SPACE that was the one I was trying to wade through

      TEXAS HISTORY BOOK.

    the new author that came out with, the one that, Harrison Ford starred in.: null
    the novel didn't do that much for me.: null
    the novels, yeah.: null
    the only Birmingham I could think of was Alabama.: null
    the other book I am trying to think, was in the last year: null
    the other one was quite enjoyable.: null
    the other stuff is interesting: null
    the people that she came to were just farm people: null
    ? the rea, reason I was, picked it back up was in light of all the, when they
      found the, the airplanes on the, in the Atlantic, thinking they were Flight
      Nineteen.

    try and do what's, what I can do out of it that's practical,: null
    unless maybe they lived a long, long time ago.: null
    usually I try to, to find something long that,: null
    usually when I am through with one, I will go in and, look, look through,: null
    usually, I just, if I find a good book, I will sit, for two days until it is finished. If it's that good,: null

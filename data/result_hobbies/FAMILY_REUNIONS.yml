    I couldn't tell my kids what, those people were like,: null
    I did not get to go.: null
    I didn't do it.: null
    I didn't like that much.: null
    I didn't think that was as good. Because,: null

    I grew up in a real not, I think not normal setting.: null
    I grew up in the deep south like south Alabama.: null
    I guess about two more years.: null
    I guess it has been seven years since we have had one.: null
    I guess probably the last one I went to I met so many people that I had not seen in probably ten, over ten years.: null
    I guess probably the most helpful thing was that, for the rent, we rented a, a rescue squad building or something: null
    I guess we have reunions about once a year or so.: null
    I had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions,: null

    I haven't known many of those people,: null
    I ho, I think, I hope that is not a lost art, that people getting together as they do spread out all over the world.: null
    I hope my aunt is successful as, later.: null
    I hope, it, I know it takes a lot of effort right with, with that, with two little ones like that.: null
    I just got married.: null
    I just have one aunt and my family.: null
    I just quit too .: null
    I just remember they had some funny stories,: null
    I kept thinking, this guy is putting me on.: null
    I kind of missed it this year, and felt bad,: null
    I kind of wonder what, what kind of tradition we're going to establish for our family.: null
    I know everybody's real eager to participate.: null
    I know on Sundays we all elect now to chip in: null
    I know that.: null
    I know very little about before my grandparents.: null
    I know when we had,: null
    I learned a lot about them.: null
    I live in Raleigh,: null
    I love it, all the different foods, because that,: null
    I never had enough to really make, more than a jar or something.: null
    I never thought of it really as a reunion.: null
    I often feel funny because I'm in a branch that's all but died: null
    I pressed the button one,: null
    I remember my little brother riding a bicycle through it.: null
    I said, "Hey, wouldn't you like to know what's happening with these people?": null
    I said, how is his nephew doing.: null
    I said, let's start this letter,: null
    I said, this can't be,: null
    I sort of think of a reunion with my, all the extended family .: null
    I still do kind of enjoy it,: null
    I suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy: null
    I take my boys , I took them up until this year,: null
    I tell you what, that's the neatest book we've got,: null
    I think I have seen once or twice in the museum.: null
    I think for the family.: null
    I think it has been about four or five years.: null
    I think it has been, four, three or four years. Or five even, since they have had it, tried to get everybody together.: null
    I think it would be fun to rent a big mansion or house someplace,: null
    I think it's very unlikely we'll have a family reunion,: null
    I think my dad put some.: null
    I think normal's about sixty or seventy.: null
    I think people feel less of a desire to really go.: null
    I think that was when she was three.: null
    I think the world record is fifty some pounds.: null
    I think there was four or five different people,: null
    I think we are going to try to have one this summer.: null
    I think we've been to one in thirtyfive years or something like that,: null
    I think, I do think, now we have noticed a waning of interest,: null
    I told my husband,: null
    I used to live in Indianapolis.: null
    I used to make jam,: null
    I was going to live in France for a year.: null
    I was just thinking of that.: null
    I was president of our family reunion for two years,: null
    I wasn't very at that duty, for two years in a row,: null
    I were the kids, the newlyweds, so to speak: null
    I wish we'd,: null
    I won't be adding any more to the family reunion .: null
    I won't do it with the babies.: null
    I would get on a bus any day by myself,: null
    I'm Bill from Raleigh.: null
    I'm Melanie from Harrisville, Utah.: null
    I'm divorced,: null
    I'm hoping,: null
    I'm real curious because my family,: null
    I'm sure she's, dead now, because my grandmother died in, about twenty years ago.: null
    I'm, I've worked in hotels,: null
    I've always thought it would be so neat, even if it were just my immediate family, to have like a weekend type thing: null
    I've been married now for about nine months: null
    I, I can go for that.: null
    I, I do, I do enjoy the reunions.: null
    I, I have a hard time getting, people on the telephone.: null
    I, I hope both our families get to have one soon.: null
    I, I kind of know how to do these things.: null
    I, I suspect we will do more of it.: null
    I, I used to enjoy going,: null
    I, I wish that our son was: null
    I, I would love to,: null
    I, I'm kind of in control over who comes. just from my family.: null
    I, I, jeez, I think over, three hundred: null
    I, it was supposed to be this June,: null
    I, used to,: null
    If they don't, they'll say, we're planning to go so and so that, go to, to a certain place that weekend with somebody else: null
    In fact, this past Sunday was the, was the reunion,: null
    In my, my, father's family, we get together every year at a different location, either Dallas or Oklahoma City.: null
    It had gotten so big that they had it at the church.: null
    It has been four years since I have been home.: null
    It is a lot harder for us because we are like I said we are spread out: null
    It is hard to remember,: null
    It is kind of, they're kind of off and on it seems like.: null
    It is near Lake Texoma.: null
    It is, it is, it is a country, country home.: null
    It just depends,: null
    It really is fun,: null
    It started out when I was a youngster and watching my mother.: null
    It was all in the San Antonio area .: null
    It was every summer we got together.: null
    It was fun.: null
    It was kind of fun.: null
    It was like, don't you remember me.: null
    It was on my grandmother's birthday,: null
    It was on, New Year's Day.: null
    It was part of the sewage cleaning system.: null
    It was pretty serious and lot of yelling: null
    It was quite a large: null
    It was when, his mother, his step father had died the year before,: null
    It was, it was a big deal,: null
    It was, it was an interesting theory.: null
    It went pretty good.: null
    It would run into a lot of money.: null
    It's like a,: null
    Just a few.: null
    Just like this town is too small for me,: null
    L A, Orange County area.: null
    Liked to kill me, because I ha, it was, I didn't have that group cooperation,: null
    Maybe longer than that, I'm going to get back into the fifties sometime.: null
    Most everybody is right in that area.: null
    ? Most of the family is right in the West Virginia, what they call TriState area,
      northern West Virginia, eastern Ohio, southwestern Pennsylvania.
    : null
    Most of them is down there.: null
    My family is from Kentucky.: null
    My family's not very big: null
    My family, my parents are the youngest of very large families.: null
    My father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish.: null
    My grandmother's, sister who would be somewhere in, in West Virginia.: null
    My grandparents told us when I was growing up and even when I was an adult: null
    My husband, on the other hand, was not very close to his family.: null
    My mother was complaining last year about th,: null
    My mother's father's family had quite a few,: null
    My nickname for her is Honey Woman.: null
    My uncle, put some bass in, his pond a few years ago.: null
    My wife's family, they're, they're all in,: null
    My, my grandmother in California is,: null
    My, my, dad has a house out there anyway.: null
    Nice to have everybody together at once and things like that.: null
    No that would just be a few.: null
    Nobody has this many relatives, .: null
    Nobody moves away except us .: null
    Now I'm to the mother was: null
    Now it's different because I live here: null
    Now next time we have one,: null
    One in, interesting thing that they did at the time is they, they videotaped the, the whole shebang: null
    Only thing is, it is big,: null
    Originally, I, was born in Missouri.: null
    Our family is dwindling, for one thing.: null
    Ours, ours is still kind of loosely organized,: null
    Pretty much.: null
    Right now we only have two children: null
    Sat, Sunday afternoon: null
    She has got a huge family.: null
    She has like seven sisters I think.: null
    She talked about the, the Catholics: null
    She was fishing for sunfish.: null
    She was like the glue,: null
    Since it was the first one that we'd had that, you could do that once.: null
    Some of the other people, the older people organized it.: null
    Some of the people: null
    Sometimes I call off and on all day,: null
    Southwest part of Missouri.: null
    Sunday dinner was at my grandmother's: null
    That is about it .: null
    That is what happens .: null
    That is why we have not had one in a long time.: null
    That is why we only do it once every five or ten years.: null
    That was before I started school: null
    That would be fun to see.: null
    That would be hard for us because most of the family is out in California.: null
    That's kind of how my husband and I are.: null
    That's our, was our problem.: null
    That's what I call her.: null
    That's what, that's what happened when I, when I first, met my husband.: null
    That's where I'm originally from.: null
    The first Sunday in October, the Jordan family gets together.: null
    The grandchildren.: null
    The only problem is that now, originally when we had them, they were mainly my mother's ,: null
    The people that we have that don't come are out El Paso way: null
    The rest of it is sort of a big void to me.: null
    There are enough in the area to, to just kind of span yourself out.: null
    There is kind of a set pattern to it.: null
    There is one cousin out in Colorado, some cousins over in Phoenix,: null
    There isn't any one place where most of us live,: null
    Therefore, they don't have many people left.: null
    They are good kids though.: null
    They are just spread out so much,: null
    They feed the catfish every couple of weeks.: null
    ? They had chosen Santa Barbara, California for this summer and, and did not get
      enough people that were willing to go that far,
    : null
    They have had one the last two years. We go out to the, my dad's farm and, and, and spend the night.: null
    They have regular, regular family reunions every summer.: null
    They have these places where you can rent them: null
    They just came down and say, okay, this aunt and Uncle Kip, all their kids and their grand kids and everything,: null
    They just have: null
    They just show up at funerals and weddings.: null
    They live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota: null
    They propagate pretty well, those little fish.: null
    They put one together for our family about once every June.: null
    They show up and all their kids.: null
    They usually, they have been happening, just after the summer semester starts.: null
    They'll send out news bulletins.: null
    They're going to have it at Fort Davis: null
    They, really get, into it.: null
    This is hardly, almost June.: null
    This was like everybody came into town and went to this restaurant.: null
    To send back to those other people.: null
    Twentyfive,: null
    Two or three times a year you'll get a news bull,: null
    Usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday,: null
    Usually, it is like Sunday afternoon: null
    ? We are real glad we got together because since that, that time there were only
      two of the, one sister and one sisterinlaw of the original family left.
    : null
    We could see.: null
    We did it that year,: null
    We did when I was growing up.: null
    We discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together.: null
    We go to mine regularly,: null
    We got together over Christmas.: null
    We had a great big fish fry,: null
    We had been playing in the sump.: null
    We had, the first reunion, the first, major reunion was probably six or seven years ago.: null
    We have a biographer who, who continues every year to save clippings on any family member,: null
    We have a little pond at our, at his vacation home too.: null
    We have factions, when it's one part,: null
    We just did it word by mou, by word of mouth.: null
    We kind of have a, an informal contest.: null
    We managed to get to one.: null
    We rent a pavilion and, and do that: null
    We said, "Please let us know if you're coming.": null
    We saw people we hadn't see in a while: null
    We sent invitations.: null
    We still have lots of little goldfish.: null
    We tried to start that in my husband's family.: null
    We was eight and ten years old.: null
    We were all kids anyway .: null
    We'd have two hundred and fifty or three hundred.: null
    We've enjoyed it,: null
    When you catch them, they make a kind of a, a burping, growling sound at you.: null
    Where if you said a certain thing and say, okay, we're all going to have fried fish, or, we're all going,: null
    Where nobody lives .: null
    Whoever's mom and dad it is, you usually go and stay with them,: null
    You can bring a congealed vegetable salad,: null
    You can come and go as you please type thing.: null
    a friend of mine, she plans her family reunion, every year,: null
    a lot of my family is in Indiana.: null
    a lot of that sort of thing.: null
    a lot of them lived in a group, down one highway.: null
    a lot of those people have,: null
    a number of years ago, back in the early eighties, my wife was president.: null
    again, it's not, it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there: null
    all my aunts and uncles are in their eighties now,: null
    all my grandparents are dead so, there is, there are not, none of them are there.: null
    all of his children live in the Dallas area too.: null
    all of his direct descendants, descendants have now died: null
    all of the descendants of the Civil War, yeah, the Civil War veterans come together,: null
    all, all the family lives in once place, except for a few of us are scattered about.: null
    another one from a different state besides Texas.: null
    another thing that's really good about, family reunions,: null
    anyway, they're going to go on a cruise,: null
    ? arrangements are made during the Summer for food and who's, who's staying where,
      because a lot of people fro, are from down here, in Texas.
    : null
    as he got to be a teenager, he wasn't quite as, as interested.: null
    as long as my oldest aunt lived we, we got together once a year.: null
    as, as time grew, when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth.: null
    at least that way it is at nobody's house, so nobody one, no one person is responsible for everything.: null
    at time, they all knew one another.: null
    back around, in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up, they were all located together,: null
    back, early on they used to, to rotate them from hou, from som, to, to different people's houses,: null
    basically, they just stay with each other, brothers or sisters.: null
    both of my parents had big families,: null
    calling different places can r, really run you up a bill.: null
    catfish do, I think.: null
    course we've got, we've still got it: null
    each one of the, everybody that showed up donated some money for the rent and for, for soft drinks: null
    each one of them take their turn.: null
    each person in the family, brought a dish, or something.: null
    each year it's done a little bit differently, because different people serve in those roles.: null
    each year, of course, they elect officers of the family reunion: null
    enthused and with it: null
    ? every four years on one side of my family they plan on having, my p, grandparents
      and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids.
    : null
    every one of them have five or six kids. most of them,: null
    every time you wanted to go eat with somebody, you'd probably have to go to out, eat or something.: null
    every year everyone asks: null
    every year.: null
    everybody brings lots of food: null
    everybody brings their favorite dish: null
    everybody brought their specialties, I guess you would say.: null
    everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend.: null
    everybody goes to that place.: null
    everybody got a book,: null
    everyone brings in food: null
    everyone has to update their little: null
    everyone is spread out all over Timbuktu.: null
    everyone would just bring things: null
    everyone, they get the community building there at Lake Texoma lodge,: null
    finally, you're lucky to get, you get the Shreveport relatives there, but no one else: null
    folks have gotten so mobile,: null
    for the Saturday night dinner they bring in Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant,: null
    generally when I was growing up a lot of those people, the only time I ever saw them was at the reunion,: null
    generally, I think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people.: null
    getting through to anybody.: null
    he does not really have any, any, domestic livestock anyway.: null
    he had another cousin he was close to and went,: null
    he had to kind of get used to us when we first started going together.: null
    he has a large family,: null
    he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any .: null
    he just has himself and his brother and his parents,: null
    he keeps a s, food out there,: null
    he kept saying, this is where my uncle lives: null
    he leased, to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on.: null
    he left it in the middle of the pond .: null
    he put some crappie too.: null
    he reminded me,: null
    he wants your really big ones, the ones that get to be a foot and a half long.: null
    he was trying to catch them, using little,: null
    he would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish.: null
    he's from here: null
    he's just, he's newly married and doesn't have children: null
    he's trying to get in med school,: null
    here it would be a huge amount of land.: null
    ? hi, in his family, what they usually do, on his dad's side, his mom or, the
      aunts will send out little postcards, two or three weeks before reminding everyone
      where the, the, where to meet and, just, to bring anything,
    : null
    his mom's side of the family, they all, have their family reunions in southern Utah: null
    his mother was alone, they came to support her,: null
    how I would go about doing it is I would just call all my relatives.: null
    if I can ever get down to Kentucky.: null
    if I didn't want somebody to come, then I just wouldn't send them one of the questionnaires.: null
    if it was my mother's turn: null
    if it's elsewhere, other people come: null
    if she didn't have arthritis, she'd get around better: null
    if there was a sickness or something like that, you're not going to lose: null
    if we could have gotten it by a lake or something, I thought that would have been much better.: null
    if we ever had a reunion, we'd kind of all have to stay in a hotel.: null
    if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance,: null
    if you wanted them both to come,: null
    immediate family we do, we try to do one thing once a year.: null
    in Kentucky it wasn't hard because everybody lives so close together.: null
    in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood,: null
    in fact, many of my first cousins are dead: null
    in my family, let's see, last October was the forty fifth annual: null
    in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family: null
    in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year.: null
    inevitably everyone is just very interested: null
    it does remind us that we have family and roots.: null
    it has away been the same park: null
    it has been over three years since I have been home: null
    it has everybody that you could ever imagine,: null
    it has little rooms off of it where,: null
    it has the entire,: null
    it has, it seems by doing it about six months ahead, they can pretty much get everybody there.: null
    it is easier for us few stragglers to go home.: null
    it is going to be hard this time.: null
    it is harder for everyone to get in, get home.: null
    it is just, very humid,: null
    it is kind of hard to get ev, get everybody organized.: null
    it is not that big.: null
    it is open.: null
    it is probably not going to be done because I have not heard from them.: null
    it is the best time to take pictures,: null
    it is, cat food, catfish food.: null
    it just got out of hand,: null
    it just grew and grew and grew,: null
    it just kept coming on up through the generations.: null
    it just never: null
    it keeps the family alive,: null
    it kind of wound down,: null
    it may have been that, that long since we have one.: null
    it really sounded like it was fun.: null
    ? it seems like most of the family is, going, all the nieces and all the grandchildren
      and all that are, most of them are going,
    : null
    it showed who my, who my husband's parents were,: null
    it sounds really neat, it really does.: null
    it started probably about forty years ago, because I remember going as a teenager before I was ever married,: null
    it starts on Friday and goes through Sunday,: null
    it swimmed wherever it wanted to.: null
    it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date,: null
    it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had: null
    it told where the first Connallys came over,: null
    it took eight times to find you: null
    it turned out so much better like that.: null
    it used to be held at Lake Brownwood, down at Brownwood, Texas,: null
    it usually goes through me twice a year: null
    it was a great big lodge,: null
    it was a large reunion of, of, of that group, from that descendants.: null
    it was a lot of fun.: null
    it was a raccoon that had taken it.: null
    it was a, it was good, it,: null
    it was about two years ago for,: null
    it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time.: null
    it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping.: null
    it was an experience that I, I won't do again .: null
    it was difficult to hold them together.: null
    it was friends too.: null
    it was great pleasure while we did it,: null
    it was interesting,: null
    it was just pulling drag out.: null
    it was just,: null
    it was kind of, it was a birthday: null
    it was like,: null
    it was not just family,: null
    it was not only in Mississippi, in some other places,: null
    it was not so worth it.: null
    it was really funny,: null
    it was really funny.: null
    it was really, that was really neat.: null
    it was so good.: null
    it was sort of a reunion before leaving.: null
    it was up to me,: null
    it wasn't any of my immediate family: null
    it wasn't really a fa, a planning one,: null
    it wasn't that big of a family,: null
    it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave.: null
    it went through: null
    it went through the whole family and stuff.: null
    it will be something my kids will have,: null
    it would be the second great grandchild.: null
    it's a big place,: null
    it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long: null
    it's a little north of Indianapolis, about an hour.: null
    it's a lot of fun.: null
    it's a pretty big reunion,: null
    it's about two hundred people, maybe.: null
    it's always like the second week in September,: null
    it's been fun.: null
    it's been kind of nice.: null
    it's been really wonderful.: null
    it's dwindling down every year,: null
    it's every four years: null
    it's going just for the sake of getting together,: null
    it's got a lot more people interested in it because,: null
    it's just like a day kind of thing, because most of them are,: null
    it's just too much for all of them,: null
    it's kind of hard to get her, get her there,: null
    it's like, the last one was my high school graduation: null
    it's not hard in, in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one Utah area: null
    it's not quite as close as it used to be.: null
    it's not really a weekend,: null
    it's not very expensive that way.: null
    it's not, it's not a hard back book, it's just a, a, folder type thing.: null
    it's something I really miss, because I had twentyseven first cousins: null
    it's still going on,: null
    it's the third weekend in August,: null
    it's too costly for us.: null
    it's, it does not, it's not as many people there that I really, really enjoy seeing.: null
    it's, it's fun when we go to that one.: null
    it's, it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together.: null
    it's, it's just something that they, they plan on doing every summer.: null
    it's, wound up that, we're the old folks now.: null
    it, I think it would get kind of expensive.: null
    it, has worked out quite well,: null
    it, it just kept growing and growing and growing and growing,: null
    it, it really did,: null
    it, it was around there generally.: null
    it, on a lake,: null
    just lack of interest,: null
    just this last summer we went back to Utah,: null
    just, the distance involved: null
    let me see, I think we've only planned one family reunion in our life,: null
    like I said there would be thirty, thirty people,: null
    like I said, we was just big kids.: null
    many of us came from a long way that we, we'd usually at a motel: null
    ? many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were
      going to need and, and, how much, beverages we were going to need and this and
      that,
    : null
    mixed Purina,: null
    most of his people are from Oregon,: null
    most of my family's in California,: null
    most of them are in upstate New York.: null
    most of, all my family lives in the same county: null
    most people do not have more than a couple of hours drive at tops: null
    ? my brother and his wife live in Nevada, my daughter lives in Colorado, one of
      my nephews lives in New York City, one nephew lives in Memphis
    : null
    my cousins, they just go stay with their mom and dad,: null
    my dad was in the Army: null
    my daughter, we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing .: null
    my experience, has been limited pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family.: null
    my family is from Ohio: null
    my family moved to Connecticut,: null
    my family's really all dead.: null
    my family, got together almost every week.: null
    my father has, five sisters and two brothers: null
    my father would be a hundred now: null
    my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically.: null
    my grandmother just passed away this last year.: null
    my husband and I went, while we were still dating,: null
    my husband has, on one side has an extended family,: null
    my husband talked to the people in Utah,: null
    my husband's is in San Antonio,: null
    my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us: null
    ? my immediate family, my, my parents and my brothers and sisters, I guess we're
      the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever,
    : null
    my mom's family does it once a year, just like you said: null
    my mom's family now,: null
    my mom's family, each brother and sister takes a turn one year,: null
    my mother has four brothers and two sisters.: null
    my mother's side of the family is quite large, was quite large at one time,: null
    my mother's side we had our, our first real reunion that I've ever gone to last summer: null
    my mother's sisters,: null
    my parents are divorced,: null
    my parents invited,: null
    my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia,: null
    my two grandsons and one of their cousins are, are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song: null
    my uncle in Louisiana, he is the only one that, had to travel.: null
    my, my cousins have a, they put on a family reunion, once a year,: null
    my, my grandfather is the only one that is still around.: null
    my, my parents live in Greenville,: null
    nobody brought covered dishes.: null
    not really.: null
    now I have got a sister in Germany,: null
    now every time we plan anything, just about, we write to the Chamber of Commerce of where we're going because,: null
    now it has gotten, that, a lot of those people are d, have, have died off,: null
    now it's Lake Texoma, because that's more central location: null
    now our grandchildren are participating in it: null
    now that we have been talking about it, I, I am kind of getting home sick now.: null
    now they, have a golf tournament on the Saturday.: null
    now we go, our children go,: null
    now we hold it at, Lake Texoma so that the Oklahoma group doesn't have to drive as far.: null
    now when they come together it's, it's generally,: null
    of course my grandmother's food was, as always, gone first: null
    of course they have their own families and grandchildren and all that,: null
    of course, he died two years ago,: null
    of course, over the years it has, built up as far as the organization is concerned: null
    once a year, they have a, a, a Wednesday through a, a Saturday type thing.: null
    once it went to the, the oldest people and then they knew who they wanted to invite,: null
    one by one, his broth, his sisters, he began to lose family members,: null
    one time he left the net in the pond,: null
    our children, thoroughly enjoy it.: null
    our daughter, our daughter is really interested.: null
    our family all brought in food and everything.: null
    our family ranges from, goodness, Australia,: null
    our family right now, the most of it, there is only a few stragglers, with any distance.: null
    our family start, reunion started out my wife: null
    our father's generation was enough older than I,: null
    our grandchildren are going now.: null
    our parents came and caught us.: null
    our son and daughter are both married: null
    our son's not as interested in it as our daughter,: null
    overall we all had a good time.: null
    people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree: null
    people talk about, big family reunions: null
    people would come from Seattle to there and, let's see, Nevada and in that area, Washington and Nevada to southern Utah: null
    planning our family reunio, reunion was very easy , .: null
    pretty much.: null
    really little.: null
    really only immediate family I have left is my, my,: null
    really there wasn't any problem with,: null
    ? say the kids of those people who are not, anywhere near one another I do not
      think they feel the, the closeness that they used to be there.
    : null
    several people bring boats,: null
    she caught a catfish by accident.: null
    she has four sons and two daughters,: null
    she is, she is gone now.: null
    she said they all go camping,: null
    she said, "Here," and she handed me her rod and reel: null
    she says they have the greatest time,: null
    she says, usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person,: null
    ? she talked about that and how the, the big picnic table was the symbolic communion
      of the people gathering together, and, about the bread and the ritual placement.
    : null
    she took that summer off.: null
    she's eightysix.: null
    since then we have lost, just our grandmother.: null
    since they've moved back to Carolinas, we still are the only ones do not live in: null
    six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them.: null
    so } they cancelled that one and, are looking next year bringing it back closer,: null
    some is in New York: null
    some just come in for Saturday: null
    some of them live in that area,: null
    some people don't .: null
    ? some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up
      and play volleyball all day and get really fat .
    : null
    somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon: null
    somebody brings the volleyball net,: null
    somebody suggested to get a bass.: null
    sometimes that is the best time to catch them.: null
    sometimes we would go to Arkansas where they came from and have a reunion with the entire group,: null
    sometimes we would have a reunion with that group.: null
    sometimes we've gone: null
    sometimes when these other families get together, they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and: null
    still, they're not done on a regular basis: null
    that cousin kind of quit going,: null
    that doesn't cost you as much.: null
    that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now.: null
    that happens to be my specialty for that family.: null
    that is about it .: null
    that is kind of what happened with ours.: null
    that is not bad at all.: null
    that is the hardest part about getting the fam, the stuff together: null
    that is where the ponds are and where everybody fishes.: null
    that is, it's, it's a lot of work,: null
    that makes it kind of tough.: null
    that night he came out, and the trap was gone.: null
    that person can call, beforehand and just make sure everyone knows, too.: null
    that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the Texas family.: null
    that was a great big thing,: null
    that was a real challenge,: null
    that was kind of fun.: null
    that was part of the problem with the ones we have.: null
    that would be fun.: null
    that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together,: null
    that would be kind of fun.: null
    that would be so wonderful .: null
    that would make them, grandfather, great grandfather, great great grandfather,: null
    that's a pretty good idea to do it that way.: null
    that's a real good idea.: null
    that's all the family,: null
    that's as far as it got.: null
    that's back in the: null
    that's been very nice,: null
    that's big by itself.: null
    that's how they divide it up: null
    that's in New York,: null
    ? that's interesting because one thing that always brings to my, husband's mother's
      side together is, they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time
    : null
    that's just how it is.: null
    that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large,: null
    that's my husband's side and my mom, my mom's, my family,: null
    that's no, no thing.: null
    that's not hard,: null
    that's the reason it ended up in a church because,: null
    that's the way it's kept in order.: null
    that's usually works out to be pretty good.: null
    that's where the family: null
    that's why I checked that I wanted to do that, because I would love to plan a family reunion sometime.: null
    that's wonderful.: null
    that's, that's the best way I found,: null
    that, that is only about three and a half feet long.: null
    that, that works pretty well that way.: null
    that, we went to the reunion in end of Jul, June and first of July: null
    the Catholics would make a pilgrimage in older Europe,: null
    the big ones never got bigger.: null
    the ca, the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water.: null
    the channel catfish get up to,: null
    the cousins are closer to our daughter's age, and, than to our son's and just totally different,: null
    the day it happens is ninetyeight percent of the planning usually.: null
    the few previous ones I've had,: null
    the first one is to just kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making,: null
    the first time I went was about fiftyseven, I think.: null
    the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties.: null
    the kids are already back in school: null
    the kids would sneak off.: null
    the last time we had one it was so fun.: null
    the next one was when I graduated from college,: null
    the old people cannot take it anymore.: null
    ? the organize the, who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there,
      who's going to rent the tables, who's going to see to it that the silverware
      gets turned back to the caterer.
    : null
    the others live in close neighboring, states, like Nevada, Arizona: null
    the people who are down there, they'll assign one person in the Utah area, one person in the Washington area: null
    the problem is we are all really scattered,: null
    the rest of the family stayed in New York: null
    the rest of them are within, a couple hours drive.: null
    the second reunion, people who maybe, had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought, it's not that big a: null
    the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to Disney together.: null
    the sister is in a nursing home,: null
    the sisterinlaw died: null
    the thing is I know a lot of stories,: null
    the thing is, that, the, the real part is there are two mailings that go out,: null
    the younger generation, the next like my cousin's children, I don't know very well,: null
    the, his, his dad's family is all around the area: null
    the, probably the biggest challenge was getting a place where everyone, could eat comfortably and, and everything,: null
    the, the parent who's turn it is, the child whose turn it is: null
    the, those were all brothers and sisters a lot: null
    then again, I, I have some aunts that, I, I, I do.: null
    then an uncle is dead.: null
    then it has a kitchenette and things like that: null
    then one brother and sister from each family.: null
    then the following summer, we did not have all of the family there.: null
    then they had,: null
    then those in turn got a hold of these other ones.: null
    then we have the same attitude when it's out,: null
    ? then, about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when
      you meet them at the reunion, you do not feel like, I do not know anything about
      this person.
    : null
    then, they sent their little things to us.: null
    there are four of them who live here in Texas, and his mom and dad.: null
    there are others in the family who do them better.: null
    there are some a lot younger, an, about four generations, I guess.: null
    there are still about eight or six, eight or ten people taking pictures.: null
    there have been some really wild shows put on there.: null
    there is nothing really special there.: null
    there is wild blackberries there too.: null
    there really wasn't a problem that way.: null
    there was a lake,: null
    there was, there was, there was a baby pool,: null
    there were too many little goldfish,: null
    there would be like thirty people.: null
    there would be one person who lived there that would have a house,: null
    there's a big community hall in Vernon: null
    there's a lot of things there you have to stop,: null
    there's a place they, they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon,: null
    there's little, nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that.: null
    there's no way, there's: null
    there's some my age: null
    there's usually between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people.: null
    there, there's,: null
    they all lived down there by it.: null
    they all met,: null
    they always have, two or three new ones to add to the list, someone's been born or: null
    they are all getting very, very old.: null
    they are both remarried: null
    they are in there, but they are real spooky.: null
    they came from all over.: null
    they can all stay in those cabins.: null
    they charged us, I think it was like, it was like five or six dollars, I can't remember: null
    they come as far as, Seattle: null
    they come as far away California,: null
    they come from, they all meet in Portland: null
    they come up to the top, and you can see their whiskers come through the water.: null
    they come up to the top.: null
    they couldn't put everybody up.: null
    they do not have to clean up afterwards.: null
    they do that once a year.: null
    they don't ever plan it li, as, like you do.: null
    they don't see each other very often,: null
    they get huge.: null
    they get real fat.: null
    they go camping,: null
    they had a church service ahead of it,: null
    they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff: null
    they had people come in from out of town: null
    they had planned: null
    they had some activity,: null
    they have a really good for the whole weekend.: null
    they have generally a show or an auction or something on Saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such.: null
    they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes, to pitch,: null
    they have to start talking about it, or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody,: null
    they have various organized,: null
    they have, lot of times they'll have little cabins,: null
    they haven't had a reunion since then.: null
    they just have a, a day picnic,: null
    they just meet at, a park or something to have a, a short, a small, dinner type thing.: null
    they just notify everyone by mail,: null
    they just plan on being here.: null
    they just sort of do a little program or, something like that so: null
    they just stayed with different ones of them.: null
    they live up in Sherman.: null
    they managed to get just about everybody, everybody into town, last November: null
    they organize a baseball game for the kids: null
    they plan the reunions,: null
    they really do.: null
    they routinely use them for bait for, goldfish for bait: null
    they send out,: null
    ? they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and
      their best friends, cause they all grew up in New York City,
    : null
    they took some rooms down at a Holiday Inn: null
    they tried to, to centralize it in one spot.: null
    they try to hit you with their tails.: null
    they want to come back.: null
    they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again .: null
    they were all in the same ar, geographical location.: null
    they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in,: null
    they will just, they will just come after anything then.: null
    they will rent a pavilion on a weekend,: null
    ? they would, assign a different person, each time they had a reunion they'd assign
      a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody.
    : null
    they're a lot of fun,: null
    they're a lot of fun.: null
    they're all kind of local and close,: null
    ? they're entered into a, a wonderful, scrap book. And pictures of new babies
      and new people who have been added and, and obituaries to those who are gone.
    : null
    they're fun,: null
    they're grown and gone from home now: null
    they're only three out of five of us who have children.: null
    they're pretty much just reunited always: null
    they're really kind of fascinating.: null
    they're usually quite similar, I think.: null
    they're very dedicated to that,: null
    they've had auctions and various things to raise funds,: null
    they've tried passing the hat,: null
    they, for as long as I can remember, have had, a yearly reunion,: null
    they, planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin: null
    they, they had a family reunion for, for my motherinlaw at her seventyfifth birthday,: null
    they, they stay slender until they get to be, eighteen inches long, and then they start to widen: null
    they, they take their family.: null
    this has been going on at least, at least twentyfive years or thirty,: null
    this house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres.: null
    this is a really neat thing to do too, that they did,: null
    this is a very timely topic inasmuch as we're going to a family reunion this weekend.: null
    this is more country western group: null
    this is my dad's part, side of the family is planning a reunion, this spring,: null
    this is one that's, the Baker family reunion: null
    this is the first reunion with my husband's family I've really been involved with,: null
    this is the standard pattern.: null
    this is where my aunt lives and my uncle,: null
    this one has been well organized: null
    this one was my husband's: null
    this was before I lost a lot more of my family,: null

    we are very conscious of, most of us are very conscious of, of, sanitation aspects,: null
    we are, we have one, we are going to have one on Memorial Day, I guess.: null
    we bought food there.: null
    we choose to bring congealed salad.: null
    we could try it.: null

    we found what we thought was just an old water hole.: null
    we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other.: null
    we go get Kentucky: null
    we go to my husband's occasionally down in Temple,: null
    we had a wonderful tim,: null
    we had one,: null

    we have got hundreds in there now,: null
    we have got, my wife and I have, a bit longer ways to go than most.: null
    we have had as many on a Saturday night,: null
    we have it usually at this, at this one park because there is a pavilion there, in case: null
    we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet.: null
    we have not in some years now.: null
    we have relatives scattered out all over Louisiana, Mississippi, here in Texas: null
    we have three grandchildren: null
    we have to plan anywhere from six, really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone, can start their, vacation time.: null
    we have virtually no, no background on, on her: null
    we just have to either or,: null
    we just, we had two baseball bleachers full of people,: null
    we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it.: null
    we kind of met halfway: null
    we kind of take our food for three days,: null
    we manage, those people who are at that core group manage to keep, keep the vigor alive.: null
    we met in Florida.: null
    we met, it was my,: null
    we need to have another one.: null
    we need to see them soon.: null
    we never get them at both of them: null
    we never got enough.: null
    we planned a family reunion this spring. where we are from Texas: null
    we really need to, no matter ho, what kind of crowd they get.: null
    we sent out five hundred, announcements, because our family is quite large, like your, your family there.: null
    we started with, I think, ten or twenty little feeder fish that I picked up for a dollar,: null
    we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time: null
    we usually go to my family reunion,: null
    we usually meet at my uncle's cottage in the, at the lake and, make a couple days of it.: null
    we very rarely all of us get together: null
    we was going swimming.: null
    we were f, we were living in Utah at the time.: null
    we were going down,: null
    we were just being kids,: null
    we were very close family,: null
    we won't be going because, I don't know how they thought of this, it's going to be on a cruise,: null
    we would have group like that in Arkansas.: null
    we would want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys, the goldfish too .: null
    we'll have to think of something more creative to do.: null
    we're a long way away,: null
    we're all there: null
    we're going, my gosh.: null
    we're kind of off on the sidelines.: null
    we're kind of scattered right now.: null
    we're kind of.: null
    we're recording right now.: null
    we're talking about second and third great children here.: null
    we're, we're spread out,: null
    we've had as many on a, Saturday night as about two hundred and fifty.: null
    we've we had a problem with that.: null
    we've, had various things over the years, to raise funds for it: null
    we, I have one reunion on my mother's side,: null
    we, get together, at the, the park, the, the park, and playground area of the Church I was raised in: null
    we, we have a family reunion on my mother's side of the family that's,: null
    what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family.: null
    what they did, they had, a book made up: null
    what we are left with is the, the relatives of, of,: null
    what you can do is, you can write different places, the Chamber of Commerce,: null
    what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put the, your new letter on the top,: null
    when I go home I try to see the families, as much of the family as I can: null
    when he was a chil, a young, preteen, when he was like ten or twelve: null
    ? when the Protestant ethic happened in America, there were people who ever went
      out and, went away from the family to seek their fortune, and then had to come
      back home for their reunion, so that,
    : null
    when the time came, only about half that amount of people came.: null
    when they, when they talked to us or when they sent us the letter, it, to get the information and all,: null
    when we do, and everyone finally does get together,: null
    where I am calling from is southern Mississippi.: null
    years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side: null
    yesterday I talked to someone upstate, I'm not even sure where,: null
    you are kind of,: null
    you can have cookouts and stuff like that: null
    you can't get it exact, usually,: null
    you could catch a couple anyway: null
    you could see that,: null
    you could see where the trap, the trap was dragged and things like that.: null
    you do not really feel that that really close to them.: null
    you get all the wonderful old family recipes,: null
    you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too,: null
    you had a choice: null
    you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring.: null
    you have to have it, fairly early in the summer or it is too hot up there.: null
    you have to really just get an accurate amount,: null
    you have to sit at a table and just,: null
    you just bring the covered dishes.: null
    you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it.: null
    you probably do good just to get your immediate family together.: null
    you would have sent, you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them,: null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    A lot more convenient.: null
    And choose,: null
    Every family has all that going on,: null
    Have a big family, I guess,: null
    I guess interesting if you had a, a, a very extended family that, that kind of involved a lot of people that: null
    I guess, ours probably isn't that big.: null
    I know, that's really neat.: null
    I think as, as parents get older and start dying off, I think sometimes it is hard to keep the interest going.: null
    I think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind: null
    I think that is probably why our is probably so interesting is cause we don't have them that often: null
    I think that's what happens when they get scattered,: null
    I think we need to find a new place .: null
    I think, think they're really fun.: null
    I would say you're spread out, then.: null
    I'm sure location's really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be.: null
    I'm, I'm quite a bit, I'm probably a lot older than you are.: null
    I'm, I'm sure they're a lot more organized too, because they've done it before.: null
    It helps you hang onto your roots.: null
    It is difficult with little ones.: null
    It is not a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that.: null
    It really makes an effort on, to,: null
    It was the Protestant version of the Catholic pilgrimage.: null
    It would have been. Something for the young people: null
    It's more of a, a smaller, smaller unit,: null
    Maybe what you could do if you couldn't get into a full family reunion,: null
    Probably lots of laughs.: null
    Southern California's still pretty large.: null
    That is a good idea.: null
    That is surprising.: null
    That is the best part of it.: null
    That makes a big difference, too.: null
    That makes it a lot easier.: null
    That's a heavy burden.: null
    That's really neat.: null
    The cleaning up can be a mess.: null
    all, it's a home centered, it's all family centered anyway,: null
    also one thing that's helpful,: null
    everybody just shows up.: null
    he has eight brothers and sisters: null
    it didn't sound,: null
    it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging.: null
    it is always that hard to get everyone together.: null
    it is probably in there just burping goldfish.: null
    it is so fun.: null
    it requires a lot of effort to, to,: null
    it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along.: null
    it's gorgeous.: null
    it's just the way, I think society is now, is that we are not, we do not have the extensive family we used to.: null
    it's not fair that everybody not contribute,: null
    it's very pretty country in there I think,: null
    it's, it's fun getting together with immediate family.: null
    it's, it's going to be exciting for them, and for us too.: null
    it's, it's good for kids to know that they have other family.: null
    that keeps you busy.: null
    that was another milestone, I guess .: null
    that will be fun: null
    that's a start.: null
    that, that is a problem with the distance.: null
    that, that would be,: null
    the family lives too close together, they see each other too often: null
    the officer idea is a good idea.: null
    the, the family unit, falls,: null
    things like that have to be planned,: null
    this is an unusual topic.: null
    time flies so fast,: null
    we get so involved in our work lives and just,: null
    we need to have more and more of them.: null
    we, we tend to try to do things, I think with our immediate family,: null
    you can't go every year,: null
    you equated the family reunions as,: null
    you have, you have: null
    you kind of forget what happened, and who they were from the time before.: null
    you need another milestone,: null
    you usually are living where your parents live: null
    your, you don't have to come home,: null

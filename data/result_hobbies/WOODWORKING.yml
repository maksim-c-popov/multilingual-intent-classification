    : null

    I've used mine on treated wood: null
    ? I've, also, I've also used them for building drawers where you, for rabbeting
      and, because, rabbeting on my table, on my, radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain
      .
    : null
    I, I actually have a Masters of art: null
    I, I debate whether it's better to get a, just a straight table saw or to get one of these, rotary arm saws.: null
    I, I do do things, that might be too crude to be called woodworking.: null
    I, I enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking: null

    I, I'm envisioning, a water, a watermelon like a log: null
    I, I'm signed up for a class in pottery making because I've never tried that yet: null
    I, I've done the same. like the trim around the house: null
    I, I, put together a, a, up rolltop desk from scratch.: null
    In fact, I just sent to Shop Smith: null
    It looked really cute,: null
    It seems, it seems like they go real good,: null
    It took me a lot of time: null
    It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.: null

    That you dial in on the side.: null

    ? The latest project that I've been working on this has been kind of sitting here
      for a few months } is a, a cabinet to, to put a T V in.
    : null
    Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons.: null
    They've plastic parts and stuff.: null
    We did it on a, I had a, I did it: null
    We have one.: null
    We remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets,: null
    You would put your sell price: null
    a few years ago, we needed, they needed some book shelves: null
    also I, I sometimes think that, I enjoy doing that: null
    also with a router, you can, make ornamental facings, too better than a just straight wood edge.: null
    anything that looks like it might be country is what they want,: null
    as far as wood work, that's all we've been doing right now.: null
    country seems to be the in thing out here: null
    everybody wants little country pieces.: null
    getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about .: null
    gotten a, a good belt sander: null
    he cuts them out,: null
    he has all day long that: null
    he likes using the little band saws and jig saws: null
    he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw.: null
    he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great.: null
    he's got a lot, a lot of tools,: null
    he's got a router,: null
    he's retired now: null
    if I touch it, it turns into something us,: null
    if it cost me twenty dollars,: null
    if the customers are willing to pay it, then you get a profit.: null
    if you're looking at adding on you have,: null
    in fact, I'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son.: null
    it turned out to be really nice, a nice desk.: null
    it's in art education.: null
    it's just a wooden doll with a painted face: null
    it, the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw: null
    jobs being what they are, I substitute teach: null
    k, kind of, mainly the woodworking I've done lately is, made for example a little nativity scene.: null
    let's do something else.: null
    little by little, I, I started out with just basic hand tools and kind of added on to things.: null
    lot of the equipment, too, that I've, I've used in the past, I w, I've used in school: null
    lot of the things that, we can't be able to afford,: null
    my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood: null
    my projects had to do with acrylic painting,: null
    my wife has picked up a couple of things saying, if we could refinish that, that would be a beautiful piece of furniture: null
    nice it's nice tongue and groove, construction.: null
    now I use it twice a year maybe .: null
    now all my blades need sharpening.: null
    now he wants a plunge router.: null
    now, I've got to jump back in and finish the,: null
    once I get so, really pretty good at something, I want to try something else .: null
    over the years I've, I've refined those plans.: null
    that boutique, they take, what was it, } twenty percent of the sell price.: null
    that way I have time for my kids too.: null
    that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel .: null
    that's been, I've been pretty successful with that.: null
    that's my ultimate dream .: null
    that's what I want, is a Shop Smith .: null
    that's worked pretty well.: null
    that, that's partly my problem now.: null
    the crayons that are sticking up, it will be the headboard: null
    the router, helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router.: null
    the teacher was one of these negative people,: null
    the watermelon, the red with the, with the seeds painted in: null
    then at the end of the boutique, which usually runs for a week, then they give you what you earned .: null
    there's a lots of little things you can get to cut out.: null
    there's no coping saw big enough to, for a fourteen inch wide watermelon that: null
    there's no t, basements down here: null
    these little wooden things, they seem to sell really good.: null
    they don't have basements.: null
    they have a really fancy boutique out here in Ogden, Utah: null
    they would take twenty percent off of that: null
    they're cutting back,: null
    they, they dull after awhile.: null
    this little rabbit that I made in, tole painting class, is a welcome.: null
    to do the, th, the turn cut.: null
    we built a cradle for it: null
    we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of: null
    we got th, we got one s, one cut out on the table saw, on the radial saw,: null
    we have Home Depot out here.: null
    we stripped it all the way down and refinished it: null
    we've done it a couple of times.: null
    what I need next is a good table saw.: null
    what we want to do is, make them, and then maybe take them to these craft shows or: null
    where, where we lived before up north,: null
    with, with the router you can make nice,: null
    you didn't buy it,: null
    you drill holes around the top of the head: null
    you get the tools you don't: null
    you have to decide what your price is going to be: null
    you made it.: null
    you move the saw.: null
    you, you make the dress for it,: null
    you, you set the wood down: null
    you, you stick in: null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    Big solid pieces of oak are just: null
    I guess dado joints is what it's called.: null
    I imagine if I go and sharpen them myself, they won't last .: null
    I think the, the main thing is, like you say, it's a, it's a good out.: null
    I've been fortunate that I can afford to work parttime.: null
    It's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day: null
    It's, it's also a way of relieving stress.: null
    Radial arm saw is, I guess, what they're called.: null
    That sounds like a good idea.: null
    That's a good way to get started.: null
    That's good.: null
    That's neat.: null
    That's, that's a kind of low risk sort of project, isn't it I guess.: null
    They are really cute.: null
    They're handy, they: null
    Those are darling.: null
    Treated wood can really make you sick too.: null
    Whereas if you're ripping wood, you're probably better off with a, a table saw.: null
    You could make a lot of money from those.: null
    a table saw does take a lot of time, a lot of space and is a pretty big investment.: null
    any, any time you buy a, a: null
    he'll be delighted.: null
    if you could get your projects into boutiques, they are wonderful.: null
    if you're going to use for a lifetime I suppose it's worth it.: null
    it actually worked pretty well: null
    it is out of necessity: null
    it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion.: null
    it t, seems to me the radial arm saw is, is better,: null
    it's a great stress, stress reliever.: null
    it's kind of, hard to get, shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room: null
    it, it takes up less room.: null
    it, that's works well because you can design it to, to suit whatever equipment you have: null
    that's, that is right,: null
    that's, that's good.: null
    that, that wears a bit down.: null
    ? the price of a good set of, carbide steel, bits is probably, a, a good set of
      bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars
    : null
    then you're that much farther ahead .: null
    these little things are so cute, though,: null
    those are so cute.: null
    ? with a radial arm saw, if you do have a, a big piece of wood that you need to
      rip, like you say, or cut, you wouldn't be able to do that.

      that maybe, these guys are right, maybe they will come through and, and do something
      this year.

    I think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year,: null
    I think we have talked about football for five minutes.: null
    ? I think, in, in trying to follow, the Cowboys over the years I think, they used

      except for about the last about five or six years
    : null
    I thought he was kind of cocky or something.: null

      football on T V when the Cowboys were playing the Saint Louis Cardinals
    : null
    I was proud.: null
    I was rooting for the Cowboys.: null
    I was so mad I got up and went and called,: null
    I was trying to get my son to sing that.: null

    I'm not a Jimmy Johnson fan.: null
    I'm not a fanatic about it.: null
    I'm not a real, great football follower,: null
    I'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as I have been so .: null
    I'm not going to decide I don't like them just because they're having a few bad years.: null
    I'm not sure, I'm not sure who they play.: null
    I'm originally from San Antonio: null
    I'm pretty sure he was this past season.: null

    I'm trying .: null
    I'm watching them on T V right now.: null
    I'm, I don't have a real love for Miami anyway.: null
    I'm, I keep waiting for the Eagles to get over the hump.: null

    I've been keeping up with the Saints a lot.: null
    I've been to a couple, I've been to a few games before.: null
    I've been trying more this year.: null
    I've been wanting to go to a game,: null

    I've done that once or twice.: null
    I've got a friend that, lives right next to the Cowboys' training camp.: null
    I've like to watch,: null
    I've lived in so many places.: null

    I've never been over impressed with him.: null
    I've, I've never liked Ph, Philadelphia, the city a whole lot.: null
    I, I actually live in Florida.: null
    I, I always enjoy watching the stal, the, Dallas and Pittsburgh together.: null
    I, I can go on and on about football,: null
    I, I come from a large family: null
    I, I kind of like the Cowboys, too.: null
    I, I never really was a Cowboys fan until I moved down to Texas.: null
    I, I really don't like D C a whole lot at all .: null
    I, I still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just, they just impressed me as being so efficient: null
    I, I sure am scared of them Giants .: null
    ? I, I tell you, it's difficult in that guy's position coming into that because
      there, he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many
      big things,
    : null
    I, I think about that a lot.: null
    I, I used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain,: null
    I, I watched that game: null
    I, I went to Purdue University for a couple of years and,: null
    I, I wish I would have bought the tape when I was in, Te, in Colorado.: null
    I, I'd have to confess I don't really scope out the New Orleans games, per se.: null
    I, I'll take the passing teams any day.: null
    I, I'm married.: null
    I, I, I am a pretty big Dallas fan, been for a long time: null
    I, I, I like, I like watching on Saturday afternoons when they'll have the plays the, the best plays from,: null
    I, I, I live near Baltimore: null
    I, I, I transferred to Delaware and graduated there.: null
    I, I, I was never really a big Dallas fan: null
    I, have been at my computer all day: null
    I, never been real thrilled with, not,: null
    I, to be honest with you, I find th, that too much running gets pretty boring as well: null
    Ice and rain and everything.: null
    If they would just quit blowing it.: null
    In a way Aikman has done some of that.: null
    In a way that happened this past season,: null
    In fact, I think they're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback.: null
    It was like I was sitting on the edge of my chair, going no, no.: null
    It was the same year that Buddy Ryan got fired.: null
    It was the, the Bills, Eagles game, which appropriately enough: null
    It was wild.: null
    It's a couple of hours, west of Minneapolis.: null
    It's divided,: null
    It's funny, over the years.: null
    It's like about two weeks ago I was watching the Saints.: null
    It's like the Liberty Bowl Liberty Stadium in Memphis holds about sixtytwo,: null
    It's like you guys aren't going to get a baseball team, I'm sorry it's not going to happen.: null
    It's pretty much going between Washington.: null
    It's too much running for me in, in college football.: null
    It's, a couple of blocks west.: null
    It's, it's kind of interesting to see, to see their claim of, world football.: null
    It, it's a small town.: null
    Jerry Burns.: null
    Jim Hart was playing.: null
    Just hadn't heard much about them lately.: null
    Like the Seahawks .: null
    Lot easier than it was a couple years ago,: null
    Marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes, because of some of the stupid stuff he does,: null
    Minnesota Vikings, used to be the general manager starting the World Football League.: null
    My brain is really working well tonight.: null
    My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers.: null
    My husband was just having a fit don't have him sing that song .: null
    My mom's an L V N.: null
    My, my, it's kind of odd. My roommate that I live with here, he's, he's lived in Pennock, Minnesota. *two utts?: null
    New Orleans just isn't, isn't one of the areas,: null
    No earthly idea.: null
    Nobody talks about it: null
    Now you, you're, you're from Texas.: null
    O U has always been known for their running game.: null
    Of course, he sat along the sidelines all season,: null
    Once the pressure gets turned on they, they seem to loose it.: null
    One is the Dallas Cowboys: null
    Patriots were so depressing this last year that: null
    People running up saying, what's the score, what's the score?: null
    Probably an old guy that played, probably before you were born ,: null
    Quite a bit.: null
    Right now I'm in Utah, of course.: null
    Right now I'm in, college,: null
    Right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams.: null
    Saint Louis is trying to get a team.: null
    San Jose, but: null
    She likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night: null
    She really likes it.: null
    She works the graveyard shift.: null
    She works the, I guess the graveyard's what you'd call it.: null
    She, she really, enjoys.: null
    Shooting for one for the thumb now is what they were saying.: null
    So far I've been trying to call all day because I keep getting these subjects like capital punishment: null
    Some of them turned out to be pretty good players,: null
    Terry Metcalf was on the Cardinals.: null
    That was kind of a funny song: null
    That was one of the toughest guys that I've ever seen in my life,: null
    That's about it,: null
    That's about the extent of it.: null
    That's another one of my favorites.: null
    That's even harder.: null
    That's my favorite team,: null
    That's pretty easy to say nowadays .: null
    That's the way it was.: null
    That's what I hear.: null
    That's what my mom does, labor and delivery.: null
    That, that sure was a fun Super Bowl to watch this year.: null
    That, that, that's boring for me.: null
    The Dallas Cowboys.: null
    The Orioles say they get twentyfive percent of their population, their attendance from D C.: null
    The only reason I really enjoy the Eagles at all is because, I really like Randall Cunningham.: null
    The other team got the ball: null
    The station finally,: null
    The, the same here .: null
    Their only time they lost.: null
    Then I like watching their bloopers too, .: null
    There are those teams that play in professional, National Football League: null
    There were, they ha, a fireworks display at halftime.: null
    There's a big, there is an old railroad yard,: null
    There's no professional hockey teams in, in Texas .: null
    They always say you've talked your ten minute limit.: null
    They are doing a whole bunch better.: null
    They did Johnny Elway to that.: null
    They didn't do too bad last season.: null
    They gave up, they, they traded Wa, Herschel,: null
    They have got a few anchors on offense and defense: null
    They just score just enough points,: null
    They make it to the playoffs it seems for the last few years: null
    They may get hurt, or, not be able to participate at that level, if: null
    They never blow out their opponents.: null
    They picked up,: null
    They played Dallas.: null
    They put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside.: null
    They take moder, popular songs and, and change them to fit, the Broncos and stuff.: null
    They traded Walker,: null
    They used to just have: null
    They won just one game: null
    They'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end.: null
    They're going crazy,: null
    They're just trying not to overwork him right now, until he gets his shoulder, back in shap,: null
    They're not, they're not my favorite totally.: null
    They're playing tonight in fact.: null
    They've always been, my favorite.: null
    They've got the U T Health Science Center out there also.: null
    They've won, I think six or seven in a row now,: null
    They, they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not, completely out of control.: null
    Thirty, or thirtytwo for really good tickets.: null
    This interstate seventyfive song.: null
    This was a long time ago.: null
    Those big piece of something came flaming, falling out of the roof and landed on the field: null
    Those guys are tough.: null
    To be honest with you, I, I probably watch, college a little bit more than I do pro.: null
    To tell you the truth, I'm not even really from here.: null
    Troy Aikman,: null
    Victor Kiam owned the, the Patriots: null
    We beat them this year in, in Washington: null
    We dec, we decided just to watch them at home .: null
    We did not get to see the end of the game.: null
    We don't even have that very much,: null
    We drive by some houses everyday that have big signs,: null
    We expected it to continue forever.: null
    We had one guy that couldn't throw: null
    We really didn't have a quarterback.: null
    We set a table up,: null
    We went to the playoffs.: null
    We're not convinced that we're going to be Cowboy fans yet.: null
    We've got the New England Patriots up here: null
    We've only been married for five and a half years.: null
    What was I thinking.: null
    You go set up.: null
    You go, three or four hours before the game.: null
    You like to pull for the underdog: null
    You see, we have the N F L that, that Dallas: null
    You talk about people calling in.: null
    a few years ago Denver was a powerhouse: null
    a lot of them would have to get out in just a couple.: null
    a really hate the Redskins.: null
    all you can do is get out of the way because here they come.: null
    almost every game that I watched it would come right down to the end,: null
    also Houston is, in Pittsburgh's division: null
    anyway, I just, I've never liked D C a whole lot: null
    anyway, they're trying to keep him, keep him, from reinjuring anything, but anyway .: null
    at one time I could name all the players on the Steelers,: null
    at the ver, in the fourth quarter they'd let them get up there either with them or, right ahead of them.: null
    basical, Route Seventy and, and Route Forty.: null
    basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now,: null
    before that it's been quite a few years.: null
    being a native Okie, I I like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing.: null
    besides I like the city.: null
    considering how, how well he gets along with, Jimmy Johnson that doesn't surprise me.: null
    either we made it or we didn't.: null
    even like, what is it, Eric Dickerson left,: null
    even making the playoffs: null
    even when Bradshaw was playing, I, I don't know, I, I didn't particularly care for him,: null
    even when we knew we were being transferred here we became Cowboy fans.: null
    every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys: null
    everybody gets in draft.: null
    everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the Super Bowl,: null
    everybody is really excited.: null
    everybody was furious.: null
    everybody was real upset, when they fired Tom Landry,: null
    everybody's really going crazy, down here.: null
    firing Tom Landry and hiring Jimmy Johnson: null
    first and foremost the Bills.: null
    first of all it was all one price.: null
    first of all, first and foremost the Bills games I want to see.: null
    for a long time I was pulling for Denver.: null
    four in a row.: null
    from the twenty to the ten yard line.: null
    from what I saw the game Houston, Houston impressed me a lot.: null
    got teams like, like Buffalo who weren't, certainly weren't a powerhouse, ten years ago.: null
    growing up in Oklahoma, there it was always the home team, kind of like Dallas is around here.: null
    had a lot of trouble with injuries, too.: null
    ? he always had this, this wonderful quality of c, being able to put his foot
      in his mouth every time he went to say something
    : null
    he gets, he sees them out running a lot: null
    he got hurt at O U,: null
    he had a, just got transferred here to ESystems,: null
    he had this cartoon in there about Jimmy Johnson's big day,: null
    he is for the L, the, Raiders.: null
    he manages to still keep playing,: null
    he pops up on the Dallas scene quite often.: null
    he said that, Aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time.: null
    he transferred: null
    he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff: null
    he was across the river .: null
    he was one of ours, one of our boys.: null
    he was one of the few who come through in history that can really perform,: null
    he was supposed to go.: null
    he's a good quarterback.: null
    he's from here.: null
    he's no longer with the team.: null
    he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks,: null
    he, he's too streaky it seems.: null
    here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair,: null
    highlights, yeah.: null
    him and Franco Harris,: null
    his name was Sam Huff.: null
    his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs, because of,: null
    hopefully they win .: null
    hopefully, this ownership can set up new direction and, keep, the Patriots in the New England area anyways .: null
    if I had to pick one, I would probably pick Sam Huff, as a matter of fact.: null
    if I saw a picture of John Elway in the, in the cafeteria at school,: null
    if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years,: null
    if they can't just put it together,: null
    ? if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the
      first three quarters or, if, if something happens that that adrenalin starts
      flowing. They say, hey, we got to do something now. And then start playing the
      game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes.
    : null
    if you think about those years that we had the losing season, of how bad,: null
    in high school I went to every football game: null
    ? in, in Colorado when the Broncos went to the Superbowl three times in the last,
      I don't know, five or six years whatever it's been. they have these songs on
      the radio.
    : null
    is pretty close to New Orleans: null
    it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a T V and watch all this stuff.: null
    it recently was sold to, some other people: null
    it snowed all day.: null
    it snowed that much in Denver: null
    it was Buddy Ryan, the one that I can't, stand too much.: null
    it was good weather.: null
    it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other,: null
    it was kind of, it was kind of different, I guess.: null
    it was right close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the playoffs,: null
    it was the, Dallas and Washington Redskins game.: null
    it was, basically, for the social atmosphere.: null
    it was, it was something else.: null
    it was, it was the scab teams,: null
    it wasn't anybody I'd really heard of.: null
    it went the other way.: null
    it'd come right down to the end: null
    it's an adventure .: null
    it's close to Philadelphia and Baltimore,: null
    it's funny watching them, them play,: null
    it's funny,: null
    it's good to, it's good to see the Bills doing so well now: null
    it's in central Minnesota.: null
    it's just that we have to play every game away,: null
    it's opening next year.: null
    it's pretty nice.: null
    it's probably closer to Fort Worth,: null
    it's supposed to be the Redskins, but we beat them already.: null
    it's, it's in the same area.: null
    it's, it's kind of hard not to be a Cowboy fan, though.: null
    it's, it's pretty, it's fun to play.: null
    it's, other than the, the big catch, with the Fortyniners and the Cowboys ba, back a few year ago I like San Francisco.: null
    ? it's, real easy access from, from south of Baltimore like, like the airport
      or more importantly for the Orioles from Washington D C.
    : null
    it, it was beautiful, right down the middle.: null
    it, it was really exciting,: null
    just on the lower levels is the highest price,: null
    just, two years ago they were one and fifteen.: null
    ? las, time, last time I went to the Cowboys game was during that, N F L strike,
      or the, when they had the scab team, teams in there,
    : null
    last year it was Buffalo: null
    maybe I'll call you back after, after the recording is finished.: null
    ? maybe the stuff that, Jerry Jones is talking about the construction and redefining
      the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off.
    : null
    maybe this year .: null
    my brother watched it on T V and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night,: null
    my brotherinlaw, is in the medical profession, he's at medical scho, school in San Antonio right now.: null
    my dad, I went with my dad to a game that one time.: null
    my family lives in Philadelphia now: null
    my family's there,: null
    my father was a football fan my whole life: null
    my parents would always have season tickets,: null
    my, my, my, my main sport is baseball: null
    not that I'll ever go.: null
    now I like them, too.: null
    now he's the number one rated quarterback in the N F L. I think,: null
    now it's like, they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that.: null
    now that Randall's coming back next season, I hope they'll be, do a little bit better.: null
    now that Steve Largent is gone, I kind of lose a little bit for them: null
    now they have what's called the World Football League: null
    now they're sectioning it off to from the, from one twenty yard line to the other one,: null
    now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item.: null
    obviously they're all going up, more or less is what it's going to do.: null
    of course, I watch every Saints game that I can watch.: null
    of course, then you're not that far from Philadelphia.: null
    of course, we had a different coach then, too.: null
    one of those was to Buffalo.: null
    or Australian rules football.: null
    partly due to ownership.: null
    pretty fast turnaround.: null
    really we didn't have a quarterback.: null
    right now I think this Memphis, they're, they're trying to get the teams.: null
    she loves it.: null
    she really enjoys it.: null
    she's a nurse in San Antonio: null
    she's been, she's been working a, on a late shift.: null
    she's really enjoying herself.: null
    she's worked that for, years, when I was small.: null
    she's, she just started a new job at a different hospital, closer to where she lives: null
    sitting here and talking about all the cities that I hate,: null
    some of them didn't: null
    some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire.: null
    somebody got injured: null
    sometimes it's too good because he throws too hard.: null
    tha, that's the way I felt about it.: null
    that Jimmy Johnson came in, too, though,: null
    that really impressed me.: null
    that they're structuring it with,: null
    that was just a good football game.: null
    that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper.: null
    that wasn't a real,: null
    that's about it,: null
    that's exactly what they said, my wife dragged me away from the television.: null
    that's kind of how I got in with the football.: null
    that's not far from where the, the new football stadium would be if we got an N F L team .: null
    that's right.: null
    that's the typical trait of the Dallas Cowboys.: null
    that's the, that's the guy that counts .: null
    that's, that's where I was when I saw,: null
    that, that says a lot for the, for his ability, though I think.: null
    the Baltimore Sun has this, cartoonist in the sports section: null
    the Colts still, still to me are the Baltimore Colts.: null
    the Cowboys are my favorite team.: null
    the Cowboys are on a roll.: null
    the Cowboys did good today.: null
    the Saints are starting to impress me this year, a lot.: null
    the band I play in, we tend to rehearse quite a bit on Sundays.: null
    the cheapest of course is going to be the end, the direct end zones.: null
    the coaches watch him all year long.: null
    the competition is, are teams that they've already beat this year,: null
    the first thing is the phone call from the, from the league saying he was, was coach of the year: null
    the guy winds up getting hurt every other game.: null
    the hype were just unbelievable.: null
    the local team was Philadelphia.: null
    the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level,: null
    the only way you're going to have a view of is this big brick wall ,: null
    the other is the Oklahoma Sooners.: null
    the players and stuff, they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too.: null
    the press would get down on Landry,: null
    the quarterback's seem to get most of the, the attention,: null
    the second was this phone call from Buddy Ryan, I got fired can you believe that .: null
    ? the teams I really root for in football are the Niners and the Seahawks, mostly
      because, only the Niners because I used to live out in California,
    : null
    the weather here and there's no mountains or anything,: null
    the, there's quite a few boys: null
    then about five years ago, four or five years ago, they started going after, specific players or positions,: null
    then he went out to S, to southern Cal.: null
    then he, he just left.: null
    then the team was sold.: null
    then we moved here: null
    there's a big long railroad shed: null
    there's a running team.: null
    there's a team: null
    there's a team in London: null
    there's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games.: null
    there's always been an interest there.: null
    there's no .: null
    there's no hockey,: null
    there's not a whole lot in Delaware.: null
    there's some other city.: null
    there's teams in the United States: null
    there's this big fire on the field: null
    there's, an old station: null
    these games go right down to the wire.: null
    they are going to come right through you if you don't do something.: null
    they beat the Chicago Bears: null
    they beat the Saints.: null
    they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another, one that was going on.: null
    they cut the show off and shorin, started showing us another football game.: null
    they did the Johnny Angel.: null
    they did. As a matter of fact,: null
    they gave away a lot of their drafts.: null
    they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't, weren't familiar with.: null
    they got so much bad publicity, too.: null
    they got that much up in the mountains, just west of there.: null
    they had a big win today.: null
    they had a real good time: null
    ? they had to kick. And, to know whether we were going to win the game or lose
      a game because they got one point ahead of us.
    : null
    they had to stop the game the third quarter: null
    they have a lot of young exciting players now,: null
    they have a young team.: null
    they have about four or five different prices now,: null
    they have all these teams from,: null
    they have always been a really strong team.: null
    they have got the quarterback there in Randal Cunningham, who's just, phenomenal,: null
    they have this World Football League.: null
    they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there .: null
    they just kind of grew on me.: null
    they lost again.: null
    they made it to the playoffs finally: null
    they never score.: null
    they picked up some from Minnesota.: null
    they really impress me.: null
    they screwed up the last couple of games.: null
    they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else.: null
    they squeaked out a game on Sunday.: null
    they still have some, some, some draft picks,: null
    they turned it around,: null
    they went one and six,: null
    they went to the Superbowl when we first moved here: null
    they were dumping the bucket and everything.: null
    they were in a shot to make the playoffs: null
    they were kind of closer to home when, when I struck up with them.: null
    they were thirty miles right up the river: null
    they won five or six in a row.: null
    they would go out and try to go for, the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche.: null
    they'd go after them saying, jeez what you really need is a defensive end.: null
    they'd go out and try to find a defensive end: null
    they'd go to all the games,: null
    they'll get close to it.: null
    they're all, they're all thinking that, they, they, they really got something going this year,: null
    they're big,: null
    they're building the baseball stadium: null
    ? they're building the stadium on the other side of the shed from the Inner Harbor,
      which is really stupid because one of the big selling points of the new stadium
      is supposed to be this view of the Inner Harbor
    : null
    they're doing good tonight.: null
    they're doing some stomping on Virginia.: null
    they're mean: null
    they're playing now during the summer months: null
    they're raising prices on their tickets.: null
    they're some sections kind of in the corner areas,: null
    they're supposed to be the hottest team in the, in the league going into the playoffs: null
    they're winning.: null
    they've got a lot of the tools to do it,: null
    they've got land set aside for a football stadium if they ever get a N F L team.: null
    they've got large medical, center down there.: null
    they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth.: null
    they've, they've built a new stadium downtown,: null
    they, if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else.: null
    they, they do a lot of fun things.: null
    they, they sectioned it out even more.: null
    they, they've actually started doing something.: null
    they, they've managed with those guys: null
    this is just something on the side: null
    this is only the second place we've lived.: null
    this is when Schramm was still there.: null
    this year they made it to playoffs: null
    today was the first game: null
    today, my favorites out of those guys were probably, Lambert,: null
    usually it's snowing .: null
    watch that watch nothing.: null
    we all ran out and bought the records,: null
    we are never, we never cheer against Denver unless they're playing the Cowboys.: null
    we beat them: null
    we can talk about something else.: null
    we couldn't a done much better than that in Buffalo .: null
    we do some cooking, some barbecueing, have a few drinks: null
    we had one guy that couldn't run.: null
    we had some wonderful, wonderful years there under Roger .: null
    we had to sit there,: null
    we had we got the ball back.: null
    we have a soccer team that comes and goes.: null
    we have two small children,: null
    we just moved here two years ago: null
    we kind of got spoiled.: null
    we love the Cowbo,: null
    we talked our wives into going with us one time: null
    we would be ahead,: null
    we're Bronco fans .: null
    we're a big hockey area up here,: null
    we're from Colorado: null
    we're watching the game.: null
    we've been trying get this new D N B two thousand printer up and running.: null
    we've got our Cowboys here: null
    when I first moved here was when they, I guess it was about a year ago they did this.: null
    when I met my husband, he was watching football: null
    when I was at the game we sat right on the front row,: null
    when I went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did.: null
    when in reality, it's really Americans playing somewhere else .: null
    when played he was from my hometown in Alabama,: null
    when the Cowboys won the Superbowl here, of course, they put together some real cute songs,: null
    ? when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the
      game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best.
    : null
    ? when they, when they drafted somebody and he didn't work out at that spot it
      really wasn't a good enough athlete to move to any place else.
    : null
    when you go to a football game in Colorado that's, there's snow: null
    without a whole lot of big name players.: null
    you've got two football teams down there.: null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    ? A lot of the, the big eight teams that used to run so much. I think they're
      starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore.
    : null
    Absolutely they get bigger and bigger, it seems every year.: null
    After awhile, I, I prefer forty, a nice forty yard flea flicker every now and then just, just to: null
    Al Davis is, he's a kind of strange character, strange, strange looking guy.: null
    An they have to be in ideal physical shape, basically.: null
    And the hand eye coordination: null
    Any t, any team that, tha, where the owner would fire Tom Landry, is one of the greatest coaches of all time.: null
    Apparently he's kind of a wild guy,: null
    As far as him scoring touch downs, I think that was kind of weird.: null
    As long as Troy Ot, Aikman doesn't get hurt again.: null
    At least they're coming around.: null
    College football is a little bit different: null
    Course, I think, you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season: null
    Dallas did better last year,: null
    Dan Reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway.: null
    Even when they were losing pitifully, people still support them.: null
    Everybody else still nuts over soccer: null
    Everybody feels like we should be able to beat them: null
    Except I think the Cowboys are on the upswing .: null
    First good season, the coach can do no wrong.: null
    Gosh, what a beating,: null
    He fights it every single year,: null
    He is tough,: null
    He just went all out every single play.: null
    He may have been the last of the old guard,: null
    He's just so big, no one can move him.: null
    He's no Spring chicken anymore.: null
    He's one of the few, Black quarterbacks that there are.: null
    He's such a motivator, he,: null
    He's such a, he's about a half hot head anyway, such a temper.: null
    He's very good.: null
    Holy smokes, I didn't that doesn't seem like very long.: null
    Houston has had some wonderful talent, down through the years: null
    I believe that's right at one point in time.: null
    I bet up here in New England as well: null
    I bet you can't guess .: null
    I can see it's more, grunted out, run the ball type.: null
    I could see the feel for that.: null
    I don't even think we have that in Texas.: null
    I don't think rugby will ever be professional: null
    I don't think we do.: null
    I guess it's just, like you say, a mass that nobody can seem t, to get out of the way.: null
    I guess most every team has so, has someone like that,: null
    I guess probably since about eightyfour, about eightyfive was when they started kind of going downhill really,: null
    I guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in.: null
    I guess we're on.: null
    I guess we're the only ones,: null
    I guess you can,: null
    I guess you have to to, to stay in the game I guess.: null
    I guess you keep those things you grew up with.: null
    ? I guess you never could really see him play, because with the Cowboys, while
      he was with the team, the rest of the team was pretty poor
    : null
    I hope they, they do better.: null
    I really am.: null
    I think I remember hearing that.: null
    I think Mike Webster was left: null
    I think football is, football is kind of a, a sport that I think you kind of, it's hard not to like it.: null
    I think he is,: null
    I think he was just probably a passing phenomena, I think .: null
    I think he was.: null
    I think it is Raleigh.: null
    I think it might be them.: null
    I think it was kind ever interesting.: null
    I think it's an,: null
    I think that hurt a lot of,: null
    I think that,: null
    I think the Cowboys probably have a, a better team.: null
    ? I think the decline of the, of the Cowboys as a powerhouse really kind of started
      with, not drafting people, the best athletes.
    : null
    I think they are because they're getting better every year.: null
    ? I think they still have a little, I think they're still such a, a young team
      I think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential,
    : null
    I think they'll pull out of it,: null
    I think they're doing pretty well this year though.: null
    ? I think they're going to, I think they're really going to do good because it
      seems like they're finally all coming together.
    : null
    I think they're starting to realize that.: null
    I think though that professional football: null
    I think tickets are,: null
    I think we're on, maybe.: null
    I think, once Jimmy Johnson gets his system established, they'll do all right.: null
    I wished, I wished they could work something,: null
    I would say the Saints ,: null
    I'm just saying I shouldn't, I shouldn't blast him like that, say, Laufenberg got out there and blew it for them,: null
    I'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play,: null
    I'm sure arthritis sets in with them,: null
    I'm wanting to say Raleigh: null
    I, I can see what you're saying about the male bonding: null
    I, I don't think anything will ever take over the N F L.: null
    ? I, I guess, when you have a whole bunch of, professional athletes that get together
      at the beginning of the year everybody's got great hopes.
    : null
    I, I just think, Marino will get better: null
    I, I, I enjoy watching him also.: null
    ? I, I, I'm sure if you go to any of the twentyeight coaches in football in training
      camp they say, we're going to be Super Bowl Champs
    : null
    I, you couldn't deny that.: null
    If not, he gets beat to death like poor old Troy Aikman has the last couple of years anyway,: null
    It can take over a small market share: null
    It has the speed.: null
    It is fun to play. If you don't value your *listenmissing a word?: null
    It makes sense because, you, you've got the flexibility if they're good athlete they can, do a bunch of different things.: null
    It was funn,: null
    It was funny.: null
    It was like they were trying, if you were good, , let's don't have you on our team,: null
    It was, defense w, w, won all the games.: null
    It wasn't nearly as much fun when Bradshaw was playing for you guys, I'll tell you.: null
    It's exciting.: null
    It's high dollar.: null
    It's just, it's four yards, three yards: null
    It's just, it's never going to reach that, that standard: null
    It's kind of, it's kind of strange.: null
    It's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball.: null
    It's such, I just think it's such a fun sport.: null
    ? It's, a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old,
      players every year and, same coach, same everything,
    : null
    It's, it must just take a hundred percent concentration, I guess, because they know they're going to get hit,: null
    It's, it's an interesting game to watch.: null
    It, it's good as, in terms of, in terms of, of a contest.: null
    Make sure we get our cash flow.: null
    Miami's had some down years, too.: null
    Not everybody can play hockey.: null
    Now it's tough and dirty team: null
    Now, they've been able to get some good players and come around: null
    Of course they play their, cards right and do some good investments, they'll, they'll do all right.: null
    Of course, there have been some other great ones too, Dick Butkis, and Bradshaw,: null
    ? Other than that, when I've, when you grow up in a city that has the, one of
      the greatest football teams until the last few years, you kind of tend to get
      caught up in it.
    : null
    Particularly football.: null
    People are pretty surprised that they, they beat the Giants.: null
    Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia, I guess last year,: null
    Rugby is definitely big in college: null
    Rugby is something else.: null
    Seahawks are good.: null
    Since they've been to Phoenix they haven't been, all that impressive, I guess.: null
    Some of them a, a bit embarrassing.: null
    Some people are going to watch it: null
    ? Spring training until you actually start going out and getting, getting out
      against the competition everything probably looks pretty good.
    : null
    That and rugby.: null
    That kind of killed them at the end of the season last year.: null
    That may not ever happen,: null
    That would be fun.: null
    That would be his specialty.: null
    That would be really great.: null
    That's a rough game.: null
    That's exactly where both of the wives came from I think.: null
    That's fun,: null
    That's just wild.: null
    That's kind of, that's kind of strange.: null
    That's okay .: null
    That's some brutal stuff there.: null
    That's why it's a go, a big college thing.: null
    That's, it gets kind of monotonous.: null
    That's, that's a pretty short career on average.: null
    That's, that's worse than football as far as violence I think.: null
    The atmosphere of being there,: null
    The guys they pick, m, may never play a game.: null
    There ain't nobody going to beat us then.: null
    There's just so much mass there, I guess they just can't,: null
    There's no question about it, because everybody was playing good together except the quarterbacks.: null
    There's quite a bit of activity now,: null
    They always think they can win, which is the way it should be.: null
    They could not pitch.: null
    They look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem.: null
    They really d, they have to have,: null
    They really ought to change the name I think in Indianapolis.: null
    They say, i, football attracts more men because of the, y, the, the, the physical aggression on the field: null
    They were super players,: null
    They're all not, mister nice guys like they used to be.: null
    They're going to go somewhere pretty shortly.: null
    They've got some, lot of really good young players that are going to, that are going to, do pretty good, I think.: null
    They've had some excellent teams, though, obviously.: null
    They've had some serious problems in the past couple of years.: null
    Those guys kill each other out there.: null
    To me it was like it's going to take them quite a while to rebuild: null
    Warren Moon's an excellent.: null
    Warren Moon,: null
    Which is good.: null
    Which is rare.: null
    You can't stay healthy and do that.: null
    You jus, never know,: null
    You probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then.: null
    a lot of them don't, unfortunately.: null
    a lot of women are knowl, as knowledge about football as I am.: null
    all of them were bad.: null
    any professional sport I think,: null
    anyway, I guess we can't talk much more about that,: null
    ? at the end of the season, the kind of got messed up with Aikman getting hurt,
      because, Laufenberg just couldn't ever really get it together at all.
    : null
    doesn't give you much respect for their team at all.: null
    during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better.: null
    e, everything, anything that Tom Landry wanted or had, he was going to change it.: null
    every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through.: null
    football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world.: null
    from what I saw they were playing,: null
    he could always get past, he'd get past six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone.: null
    he didn't get to see much action. But, too bad.: null
    he doesn't even look like he's in shape.: null
    he has a real weight problem too.: null
    he may, uhhuh.: null
    he never really got in a game, never did a whole lot.: null
    he was a good player. I guess,: null
    he was good.: null
    he'd be good at it.: null
    he'd, never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy.: null
    he's a very young fellow.: null
    he's been doing real good.: null
    he's still performing.: null
    he's very exciting to watch.: null
    he's very good.: null
    his age is about to catch up with him though.: null
    his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the Super Bowl,: null
    hopefully they'll do better this year.: null
    if New Orleans ever gets a quarterback: null
    if ever wanted, pursue anything more than your nursing degree, that, that'd be the place to do it.: null
    if that was an off night I'd hate to see when he's on a good night.: null
    if they close it in, we'll have the best of both worlds then: null
    if they even reach that potential again, they may never reach that again.: null
    if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the Super Bowl.: null
    if you go to,: null
    if you want to see them, you might just as well enjoy football.: null
    in fact they were doing better than the Cowboys,: null
    in fact, in fact the Cowboys got the best end of that deal.: null
    in the earlier years they really had some super teams.: null
    it can get really overdone.: null
    it really is.: null
    it really was.: null
    it really would.: null
    it seems that they've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as they, problems they had in the past: null
    it seems to be, moving around and, to, to New Orleans' benefit,: null
    it seems to me like they really love their Cowboys here.: null
    it takes a certain skill to play hockey.: null
    it takes a little brainwashing first.: null
    it was bad.: null
    it was funny.: null
    it was weird.: null
    it was, it was just bedlam.: null
    it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway: null
    it will take you a little while: null
    it would be tough to do,: null
    it's a good past time,: null
    it's all, it's all money now.: null
    it's easier to join them than fight them.: null
    it's funny some of their necks don't get broken.: null
    it's funny that more people don't get hurt.: null
    it's funny.: null
    it's going to be tough,: null
    it's going to take a little bit.: null
    it's just a matter of how hard, or where.: null
    it's kind of same for me,: null
    it's more high tech,: null
    it's never going to be the next,: null
    it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every Sunday afternoon or anything,: null
    it's not like it used to be.: null
    it's not often you get, many women interested in football .: null
    it's really overkill .: null
    it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do .: null
    it's, everything's, looking real good.: null
    it's, it's a gamble,: null
    it's, the coach's fault,: null
    it, it's not so much, the contest itself and the game itself,: null
    it, it, it can be, it can take over part of it.: null
    just because they had, had a couple of bad seasons.: null
    let's, let's dump him.: null
    like you say Warren Moon's an excellent,: null
    look how good we did without a quarterback this year .: null
    maybe we, maybe we'll get your guy.: null
    more, players are apt to act a little bit different when they, when their jobs and their, when it's a job and not just,: null
    no one's going to have much faith in him any more.: null
    now it's, like a taste of something different.: null
    now they're, really playing as a, good together as a team.: null
    now, now, he had a shot and, and didn't look too good: null
    obviously not very fast.: null
    of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot, if he's got a good supporting cast,: null
    of course the, a quarterback has a big ego.: null
    of course they had so many, nice, choices because their record was so lousy the last few years.: null
    of course you never know.: null
    ? of course, Mike Ditka was in Dallas for years and years as coach, is knowing
      his, knowing of his temperament, I'm just surprised he ever, kept the guy around,
    : null
    ? of course, the, the, the one, the griping is that if, if, if Washington doesn't
      get a, a baseball team then Baltimore shouldn't get a football team. Which is
      probably true,
    : null
    people were jumping ship right and left.: null
    perception,: null
    probably the guy is, probably physically strong.: null
    right now I think Memphis and, it's Memphis and I think Baltimore have a really good shot at it.: null
    since it's kind of off season, it's kind of hard to think back about all that.: null
    sounds like he's going to be all right for next season.: null
    supposedly, psychologists say that, that, men take out their frustrations by watching football: null
    that doesn't, doesn't help you in the draft.: null
    that just may be, perceived,: null
    that sounds to me more like the front office problem than coaching problem,: null
    that was just such super team.: null
    that will make the skiers happy.: null
    that would be real good.: null
    that you miss sitting home in your parlor, with, with a six pack of beer and some, potato chips,: null
    that's a good question.: null
    that's all there is to it.: null
    that's good.: null
    that's kind of cool.: null
    that's kind of funny too, as a matter of fact .: null
    that's really funny,: null
    that's suppose to be some of the, the male bonding and the, and the, the male instincts, I guess, or something about the,: null
    that's the thing,: null
    that's what you got to do,: null
    that's when you think about it, that's really not a very long time, of course.: null
    that, that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game.: null
    the Cardinals got killed by the Cowboys,: null
    the Cardinals were kind of like the Cowb,: null
    the Cowboy, Cowboys came on strong at the end of the season,: null
    the Cowboys were th, America's football team,: null
    the quarterbacks just didn't do anything.: null
    the same thing.: null
    the, the N F L draft really seems to be doing its job: null
    the, the Seahawks are an up and down kind of team.: null
    the, their, their backfield is really impressive.: null
    then with, the defense, with Bruce Smi, Bruce Smith there at linebacker there, they've got a very well rounded team: null
    then you think about how many have been in there longer than that.: null
    there are very few Black quarterbacks, or at least that are starting anyway.: null
    there is so much about it: null
    there's an element there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere .: null
    there's been so many.: null
    there's no question about that,: null
    there's only so much football you can watch.: null
    there's, there are some really big guys playing in football.: null
    they all do, I guess,: null
    they are, they are just a fun team to watch.: null
    they can't survive.: null
    they couldn't even take handoffs.: null
    they did have a fairly decent year finally this year.: null
    they get together with a bunch of guys: null
    they had such a super team.: null
    they haven't been doing too hot,: null
    they keeping talk about, going,: null
    they make mistakes too, I guess.: null
    they really do take a beating,: null
    they really do.: null
    they really were.: null
    they seem to be doing pretty good this year.: null
    they sure do,: null
    they were good,: null
    they were terrible.: null
    they'd treat him bad: null
    they'll, they'll wind up being good again.: null
    they're banking on doing good next season.: null
    they're going to get better.: null
    they're not doing bad.: null
    they're retired,: null
    they're so young,: null
    they're still behind them: null
    they're, they, they got a big thing because of the, the, the expansion going on in baseball.: null
    they've, they've not had much of a team this year, bless their little hearts .: null
    they, they have a good time and everything: null
    they, they weren't getting the draft picks: null
    they, they're always branded, as a bunch of outlaws: null
    this is the way it is.: null
    this year they had all good players except for the quarterback.: null
    to me he does, he's just so big and fat,: null
    unfortunately, of course, the Cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years.: null
    up around the Keystone and Copper Mountain, those guys will love that.: null
    wasn't that fun.: null
    we should beat them.: null
    we, every time we'd get a real good player they'd treat him bad.: null
    when he bought the team and all and it just seemed like he just decided, this is the way it's going to be: null
    when you're getting paid millions to do it, you ac, I think they take it to another level.: null
    with age comes,: null
    you can't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching.: null
    you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team: null
    you don't back them when they're not doing well .: null
    you just really can't tell what's going to happen.: null
    you probably know,: null
    you'd have to, I would have to say, someone like Montana, I guess, who's done so well for so many years.: null
    you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though for: null
    you're right,: null
    you, you back the winners: null
    you, you miss that.: null

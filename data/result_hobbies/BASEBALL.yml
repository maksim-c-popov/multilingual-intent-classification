    I was reading in the paper tonight that the Detroit Tigers are going to sign him.: null
    I was reading the book,: null
    ? I was routing for the Twins myself because, they, a couple of Ranger players

    I'm going back at the end of next month.: null

    I, I enjoy the,: null
    I, I guess I'm one of those people that if I really made a concentrated effort, I could really probably get into baseball.: null

    I, I, I don't even know, who has been winning in, as far as the, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A s: null
    I, I, I find it very strange.: null

    I, most of my friends have three or four kids: null
    I, sort of gathered that in my, subliminal memory.: null
    ? If you'll think back a few years to when the Mets were just all this sort of
      young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but weren't very sort of, well
      trained
    : null
    In fact, I've only been up here a few months: null
    ? In other words, if, if in Spring cra, training they were looking at all their
      kids, like a lot of them do, then it really doesn't give you any indication.

    It just might be the drive,: null
    It looks like they'll be doing pretty well.: null

    It was never set right.: null
    It was okay,: null
    It was so funny to see,: null
    It was so wonderful.: null

    Ivan Rodriguez wasn't even born when, when, Nolan Ryan started pitching.: null
    Last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because,: null
    Look at the Twins going from worst to first.: null
    Lots of really big,: null
    Maybe it was November I'm thinking about.: null
    Maybe that's what, that's what some teams need.: null
    Me, too, because we go all the time,: null
    My brother's like that: null
    Nolan I think took himself out after a couple of innings or something, of the game: null

    That was the Super Bowl.: null
    That was, that was the year they beat Houston in extra innings,: null
    That would drive you up a wall.: null
    That's a lot of baseball.: null

    There really wasn't a lot of difference.: null
    There we go.: null
    There were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive.: null
    There's several guys from our church try to go up there.: null
    There's was Twins there, or,: null
    They are my favorite team, too.: null

    You just don't have,: null
    You know it's just, phenomenal .: null
    a little bit from three, from thirty million dollars or thirtyfive mil,: null
    a long time.: null
    a lot of people said, you should have turned pro.: null
    a lot of wisdom in it.: null
    about that same time branches were falling off everywhere,: null
    about, about the most baseball we get is T V we play it on Nintendo.: null
    after that, if you asked me that I wouldn't have been able to tell you if that was football or baseball.: null
    all I do is teach reading all day long,: null
    all of a sudden something happens: null
    all schools were closed for almost, for over, for a week.: null
    all the girls were all dressed up: null
    all their players are signed now.: null
    anyway, someone gave an Iranian a tip of four Rangers tickets last year,: null
    anyway, they could really only have four members on the team.: null
    apparently the Rangers last year, won a lot of one run games.: null
    as far as the Twins are concerned, it seems to be real good.: null
    as far as the major league teams, I don't know, the Rangers have been,: null
    as long as I let it heal, it never really bothered me: null
    back to, maybe eighty, eightyfour or eightythree: null
    barring traffic, it's four hundred hours,: null
    baseball is still: null
    because we usually get one.: null
    boy, I saw it, I was up there on business, last June and watched a game in the sky dome.: null
    by saying I like them, I like their chances.: null
    coliseum, Wally Moon and all that.: null
    decisions like that have to be made by someone .: null
    do it while you can.: null
    eve, every once in a while, I will keep in, in touch, with maybe, who's in the top five of hitting, or something like that: null
    even the bench warmer, I would.: null
    every day I'll have a newspaper at work,: null
    every team that's, that's really good seems,: null
    every year they always knock on the door early, and then just go into their skid about, the end of June.: null
    everybody else that I've talked to has been right around here.: null
    everybody hopes that, they go all the way around here.: null
    everybody wants to do it: null
    everybody was a Twins fan,: null
    everything's pretty expensive: null
    finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run: null
    for some people it's just,: null
    fortunately the Red Sox, last time I saw the paper earlier this week, were in first place and doing quite well.: null
    four hundred hours,: null
    four hundred mil,: null
    four hundred miles: null
    from what I hear from everybody up there, they're not going to have a good year because they let too many people go.: null
    had a lot of fun: null
    having somebody get up and hit a solo home run does you, gives you run, obviously.: null
    he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen, I had my high game of two eightyseven.: null
    he can, he can stri, he can swing a couple times,: null
    he could go in the team the next day,: null
    he decided that some wealthy man tipped this Iranian,: null
    he describes it as, you sit there in a crowd,: null
    he didn't want them,: null
    he doesn't know how many years: null
    he fits right in with Texas bunch of guys, with Detroit, bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot.: null
    he gave them to Alan,: null
    he goes no .: null
    he goes to a lot of games,: null
    he got to do it: null
    he had his year this year,: null
    he hits a home run: null
    he just goes right down the tubes.: null
    he just pitched his first, exhibition game a day or so ago,: null
    he just signed on,: null
    he just works a normal job.: null
    he makes good money too doing that,: null
    he must own the biggest chunk: null
    ? he offered, to take me to one of the games because, apparently, he'd bought,
      he and four other people from Honeywell had bought a seat, a row of seats for
      the home games.
    : null
    he pitched five, five full innings.: null
    he pitched for an exhibition game for the Rangers.: null
    he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch.: null
    he said he's been saying one more, and it's been two and three, might be two and three more.: null
    he said, I get a kick out of it,: null
    he says, let me show you how to use your arm to your advantage.: null
    he strikes out a lot,: null
    he tries to go,: null
    he was sort of in between Strasbourg,: null
    he was, boy it sounds like your really up on this.: null
    he wasn't in the book,: null
    he's I thought he was the owner: null
    he's a, a pretty decent pitcher.: null
    he's been a legend for so many years,: null
    he's doing the same thing I'm doing which is, basically, an internship.: null
    he's done that for five years.: null
    he's glued at the T V.: null
    he's got one more year before he turns into a free agent.: null
    he's not that far,: null
    he's real happy there.: null
    he's still kicking around.: null
    he's their head chauffeur,: null
    he, he can't field: null
    he, he said he didn't think it should have gotten all those awards, he thought it was too long: null
    hers was the first one I got, gotten: null
    his son pitched for U T: null
    honestly, I, I do my duty and watch the sports on,: null
    hope I'm going to do it this year because, having a kid this fall,: null
    hopefully, hopefully next week I'll get back to my normal routine.: null
    how to train them so they're going to be a blessing: null
    if I've been watching the French news,: null
    if I, if I were in Detroit, I would start building the team around Fielder.: null
    if ball I would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in,: null
    if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can.: null
    if he strikes out a lot, so what.: null
    if there's a game on, he's watching it.: null
    if they were, playing the people that they're going to play, then that might be pretty good indication,: null
    if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of.: null
    if you talk to ten then they come ov, on and say, you've extended your limit,: null
    if, if you, if you compare to go to a, a sport, a, a: null
    in Dallas you don't even know who's in, in administration,: null
    in South Dakota, the Minnesota Twins are the closest professional sports team to where I was living: null
    in as much as sort of fan support helps.: null
    in fact I've got family that still lives up there.: null
    in fact, on the news tonight, Nolan Ryan was on there.: null
    in my division they do,: null
    in the major leagues, I guess there is a couple of different divisions: null
    in the movie the guy was black,: null
    in the past half a dozen years, all we've had is the,: null
    interestingly enough you mentioned football, is like,: null
    is there enough money,: null
    is this funny, as they're parking the cars the valet service.: null
    it had to be November anyway.: null
    it looks like wow, they really hit that ball.: null
    it one of those movies it's not going to be around long,: null
    'it puts a whole in your money bag, *spelling: hole': null
    it seemed to be,: null
    it seems that, they can sign him tomorrow,: null
    it takes about two hours, two and a half hours to get there.: null
    it takes me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium.: null
    it turns out my Mom said that he's part owner: null
    it was a catcher.: null
    it was a really cute little kid too.: null
    it was actually wonderful because where I was they were half Met fans and, half Sox fans.: null
    it was at least two months after I got up here.: null
    it was in the high fifties today,: null
    it was just exciting,: null
    it was just kind of funny: null
    it was kind of slow,: null
    it was nice weather and stuff,: null
    it was really funny, that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and, and how to, follow through with my,: null
    it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done,: null
    it was, about movies, what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that.: null
    it was, it was kind of pathetic,: null
    it wasn't a real problem,: null
    it went over ten minutes.: null
    it will be a dollar movie in no time.: null
    it's I should say on the west side,: null
    it's a commitment: null
    it's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games.: null
    it's a, it's a beautiful city.: null
    it's called SHOELESS JOE.: null
    it's essentially trivial statistics: null
    it's getting nice.: null
    it's going to go to the highest bidder .: null
    it's going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it.: null
    it's just amazing,: null
    it's just ten children at a time.: null
    it's just there they are: null
    it's like, they'll try something: null
    it's pretty nice: null
    it's still, it's some: null
    it's suppose to be a huge stadium: null
    it's the, it's, it's a reverse indicator.: null
    it's true bowling: null
    ? it's, it's not a great indication because there have been teams that have just,
      come out and just won all kinds of games in Spring crani, training and then
      gone on a, fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season
    : null
    it, it, it, it sits right at the limit,: null
    keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes.: null
    last night on the news I heard that they said you could, you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you,: null
    last year I just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything,: null
    last year he made: null
    last year he started having some nagging injuries,: null
    late fifties, early sixties.: null
    like I said, I'm in Minneapolis: null
    like I'm loaded,: null
    like the A s had, they had, they just had it all that one year.: null
    lots of local fans, small stadium,: null
    made it all the way through four years of college playing ball,: null
    many, things like that,: null
    maybe it was the other New York team which is the Yankees,: null
    maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can't do it.: null
    me and all my friends around here, since we don't have anywhere,: null
    me, none of me and my friends are really, really like either one of those teams,: null
    more and more these days I'm, I'll like a football game,: null
    most of the time really we watch them on the video.: null
    my Mom and Dad read all the time.: null
    my brother was supposed to go to the opening game,: null
    my brother's wife and my husband and I went.: null
    my brother, my brother is impossible,: null
    my cousin lives in Paris: null
    my family, my dad was,: null
    my favorite team is about the Rangers.: null
    my favorite team was the White Sox.: null
    my grandmother has been bowling for, gosh, maybe thirty, forty years.: null
    my h, my husband teaches in Plano.: null
    my husband's French: null
    my love wasn't there for the game.: null
    my roommate: null
    my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago: null
    my, my folks lived down in Beaumont,: null
    nobody brings two children in these seats, because,: null
    normally on my way into work I'll pick up a newspaper: null
    not a real lot,: null
    not my a lot, *sp? by: null
    not really,: null
    now I have a grandson that i, is gung ho for, football.: null
    now I won't play football anymore because of the, the separated shoulder wrestling,: null
    now my job's good,: null
    now their sons are.: null
    now they tell you what to teach and how long and, what day,: null
    of all the sports that there are, that there is, I like baseball the best.: null
    of course, I understand baseball decisions are all just,: null
    of course, Texas Rangers being one of them,: null
    of course, get a guy like Cecil Fielder,: null
    of course, there's a few more, I think are good ball teams also.: null
    of course, there's the minors.: null
    ? on the campus of Lamar University they used to house the Beaumont Golden Gators
      who were a double A team for the Padres, I think,
    : null
    one is eleven.: null
    one of the men that was in our rel, on our league, noticed, my broken arm and the way my ball would do.: null
    one of them broadcast every Twins game live,: null
    ? one thing I don't understand is why a group, headed up by George Bush would
      buy the Texas Rangers and not really get behind them
    : null
    only, Ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he didn't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing.: null
    out that way,: null
    outside of that, no.: null
    people really get into it.: null
    picking up Darrell Strawberry didn't hurt.: null
    probably south, maybe Texas .: null
    quite a, quite a bit.: null
    rather they adopted me, I guess: null
    real good as far as I can tell.: null
    really proud of him though, the way he's,: null
    right down the river,: null
    right now we don't have a girls' league because I'm the one that's supposed to start one: null
    right now we're actually having,: null
    saw, saw the Cardinals and Cubs last year, and a bunch of teams the year before.: null
    she does work with them: null
    she just liked having kids: null
    she still, she's got to be,: null
    she was real interesting.: null
    she was telling me all her problems,: null
    she's gorgeous: null
    she's lived there for off and on for twenty years.: null
    since I live here so close to Arlington, that's the team that I've been kind of following.: null
    so } we took two kids with us: null
    some of the people in our church use birth control: null
    some of them don't,: null
    somebody basically,: null
    somebody else lost,: null
    somebody walks in the, a classroom: null
    ? speaking of Bush, speaking of Bush, they that had a story where he went to visit
      some little, elementary school students, and stuff.
    : null
    supposedly what I heard, he was not much of a team player anyway,: null
    that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit, all they can do is hit home runs and strike out: null
    that got him a bonus of twentyfive thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van.: null
    that guy , the short stop, is going to be good.: null
    that new stadium's going to be real nice,: null
    that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox: null
    that was a lot of fun .: null
    that was always a problem for me was just, just the constant throwing,: null
    that was impression I got when I was there: null
    that was interesting.: null
    that was part of Skip Bayless' argument.: null
    that was quite awhile ago: null
    that was real good to talk about that.: null
    that wasn't a question,: null
    that'll be nice,: null
    that's a good question.: null
    that's about all the exposure I have to sports.: null
    that's all there is to it,: null
    that's all you hear about is, if, about Neal Bush I think is his name.: null
    that's been real good.: null
    that's just the home games: null
    that's one difference.: null
    that's one of the, entrances to the to get in and out of the city.: null
    that's part of it,: null
    that's pretty good I guess.: null
    that's the only thing that I would, be to do.: null
    that's what God's told them to do: null
    that's what I did when I was growing up.: null
    that's, that's something that we're looking forward to.: null
    that's, that's, over five months worth.: null
    that, may or may not happen.: null
    that, that was incredible.: null
    that, that's sort of close enough.: null
    that, that's what they're called to do.: null
    that, that, I think, tends to keep,: null
    the Mets won.: null
    the Redwings, which are: null
    the Saint Louis Cardinals are one,: null
    the big thing up here, of course, is the twins.: null
    the game started at seven: null
    the guy I was talking to never goes,: null
    the guy's making millions,: null
    the guy's twenty, twentyfive home rums, maybe thirty, eighty some R B Is.: null
    the kids at talk about anything: null
    the one I talked about the other night was good,: null
    the other one was country.: null
    the other thing was I'd never really let injuries stop me.: null
    the owner tried to move them to Florida: null
    the season started about a week and a half ago: null
    the speech laboratory does some work with, T I,: null
    the teams that were there last year were, somebody from California,: null
    the thing is, there's like eightysix home games per year.: null
    the topic was boring I thought.: null
    the topics are interesting,: null
    the, statistics are something like twentyone out of twentythree.: null
    the, the best I've been up here so far, up, in up state New York: null
    their biggest point of interest has been Nolan Ryan not the rest of the team lately,: null
    then I started cleaning: null
    then my father got us some tickets,: null
    then playing football this fall,: null
    there are some others out there that I don't believe deserve the money they're getting.: null
    there sure are.: null
    there used to be a, race track.: null
    there was Braves in that chanting that they had.: null
    there was, there was something wrong with him at the time,: null
    there's a good book called WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY ABOUT CHILD TRAINING,: null
    there's injuries in a lot of sport.: null
    there's no, no way that you can ever use them all.: null
    there's so many of them .: null
    there's ten tooth brushes in there.: null
    there's two fellows from, Brooklyn,: null
    there's, there's a guy on, that was on show that I listen to going to work in the morning: null
    there's, there's another point to that too.: null
    there, there's no hold outs.: null
    they are so good.: null
    they are, they're these, cycle pitchers,: null
    they beat Houston in extra innings,: null
    they did pretty well.: null
    they do that: null
    they don't quote you the proverb out of it,: null
    they don't say, they don't put on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy, I'm sure, for them to do that,: null
    they don't, she doesn't shop at Foley's and stuff like that.: null
    they don't, they don't allow you to sell it, don't allow them to sell it there.: null
    they ended up sticking around in Arlington,: null
    they feel like, that's why God: null
    they find that, tha, tha, there's a connection between that and how they do in Spring training the following year.: null
    they gave them to us,: null
    they give him all kinds of money: null
    they give you a list of things that you want,: null
    they go, we don't have one.: null
    they got that new stadium they are building.: null
    they got the hitting to go along with it.: null
    they had so many power lines down: null
    they have the later ten game winning streak: null
    they have twelve children.: null
    they hit the long ball,: null
    they just haven't been able to put anything together.: null
    they just, they probably just need something to push them: null
    they kind of fell on their face .: null
    they play a lot, they play a lot longer season, too.: null
    they put him in the lineup: null
    they really seem to,: null
    they run a whole of, of, subjects,: null
    they showed a, a, a black guy that was go, was helping out,: null
    they throw it out, and get something else,: null
    they were ...: null
    they were from Brooklyn .: null
    they were saying something about this may be his last year with the Rangers though.: null
    ? they were talking about trading him, if they're not able to sign him use the
      money that it would take to sign the guy, to pay for pitchers what it, what
      it, what they, what else they need.
    : null
    they were, toward the bottom of the league.: null
    they won't be that far away,: null
    they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes,: null
    they'll tell you they've written something down,: null
    they're a, it's a small market: null
    they're all eight and under,: null
    they're all real young,: null
    they're almo, almost starting to age a little bit here,: null
    they're going to build a new stadium in Arlington, as a matter of fact, not even in Dallas,: null
    they're going to try to make it a real community center out there.: null
    they're just raised: null
    they're never going to let liquor in there.: null
    they're not all boys: null
    they're not condemning you,: null
    they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen.: null
    they're not going to be happy about it.: null
    they're not sure they're going to be able to sign him again.: null
    they're one of the best teams in spring training so far.: null
    they're pretty balanced out all the way through.: null
    they're saying this year, their predictions is that he's really going to come out of it and,: null
    they're the big team in Rochester.: null
    they're writing the whole time .: null
    they're, they're, they're real balanced out.: null
    they're, they, they have plans,: null
    they've been, they've been young for a while,: null
    they've got Ryan,: null
    they've got it all figured out.: null
    they've led the American league in batting, fielding and pitching,: null
    they've never been able to do more than one of those in any, any given year.: null
    they, they just live lean pretty much: null
    they, they pitch one year bad, one year good, one beer bad, one year good.: null
    they, they really hurting pitching wise.: null
    they, they spent more money,: null
    they, they were fun games to watch.: null
    they, they were, they were pretty much without having to say, they were pretty much Mets fans .: null
    they, they won that one seven to one,: null
    they, they've got so much young, raw talent,: null
    they, they've got, they've looked at I think twentythree teams,: null
    this is my eleventh year.: null
    this week I've been so busy I didn't even bother to stop .: null
    three and a half weeks ago, we had an ice storm .: null
    three hundred miles.: null
    to be honest with you, I'm not from Minneapolis.: null
    to get up there.: null
    to put the ball,: null
    tonight this woman called,: null
    unfortunately they're not.: null
    we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams,: null
    we did go to a baseball game last year.: null
    we don't honor God with this portion: null
    we ended up on first base right down there on the floor,: null
    we ended up with them, right.: null
    we go quite often,: null
    we got to sit by first base: null
    we had made a list of all these, baseball teams and the cities that they were from,: null
    we have our own, our own triple A team here: null
    we just threw everything together, ran over and got the tickets and walked: null
    we made him try a hot dog, ,: null
    we met in Paris.: null
    we only had two radio stations,: null
    we only have one child,: null
    we started talking about gangs,: null
    we talked about that one too.: null
    we they called us at five: null
    we used to like watching,: null
    we used to tease about, my son: null
    we went last year: null
    we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks.: null
    we were thirty miles south of them,: null
    we're about ten miles south of Lake Ontario.: null
    we're expecting our first baby,: null
    we're heavy into that too.: null
    we're, we're pretty lucky because if I want to see a National League team, I can usually go up to Philadelphia.: null
    we've been up in the, seventies, eighties, even up in the nineties a couple of weeks ago.: null
    we, we've just got a freeway.: null
    we, we, we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they're fun.: null
    when I first started teaching, I remember I went to my: null
    ? when I played baseball when I was growing up, I had trouble, just throwing the
      ball because I wa, very, I was always very strong
    : null
    when I take a break, I'll take a look at the newspaper.: null
    when I was young I could throw harder,: null
    when he quits at being active, he will go into,: null
    when he was in high school, he enjoyed going to baseball games.: null
    when it happened he missed it,: null
    when they chose baseball,: null
    when, when he sort of went away, I started thinking, he was performing fairly well,: null
    where they're going than I do beca,: null
    with Detroit, they can get away with one guy like that.: null
    yet they attract as many if not more than most, most, other cities,: null
    you can talk for ten minutes: null
    you can watch baseball on T V: null
    you don't go to baseball games as much: null
    you don't have to.: null
    you don't know what they're there for, when they're coming, how long they're going to be,: null
    you eat these lousy the hot dogs ,: null
    you get a like that: null
    you get pictures like we did.: null
    you go to a rock concert,: null
    you got, you got to do something when football ain't on.: null
    you happen to look the other way during the time,: null
    you hope they're telling you the truth.: null
    you just can't do that: null
    you just sit down: null
    you never know where they are going what they'll report: null
    you sit there: null
    you sit there in a crowd,: null
    you think everyone should have it.: null
    you wait for the longest time really bored,: null
    you'd be sh, I was shocked,: null
    you're basically you sit there and wait for something exciting to happen: null
    you're waiting and waiting and waiting: null
    you're, you're like a boat ride from,: null
    you've got a lot of federal money, too.: null
    you, yo, if you, if you consider it, the season starts,: null
    your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids .: null
    '} at T I they have a sponsor, a junior league achievement': null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    A game is a game,: null
    A little disappointing the last few years.: null
    A lot of the psychology stuff, the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the BIBLE: null
    And Valentine and Greave, they're about to get, they're about to get old.: null
    Apparently I think his contract is up after the end of this year: null
    As far as the Rangers are concerned, I think, I think they need some, definitely need some pitching.: null
    Cincinnati.: null
    Don't let him go away.: null
    Especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all in one ni, one time.: null
    He really is an,: null
    He really is gosh.: null
    He's like a little bitty kid,: null
    He's something else,: null
    I don't care if you're President.: null
    I don't even guess they've even thought about sending the schedules out yet.: null
    I guess I'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football.: null
    I guess it's too early.: null
    I guess the, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A s were the leading teams a couple of years ago.: null
    I guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later: null
    I guess you probably love him, too.: null
    I guess, I guess when you start pitching real well, move them up. .: null
    I imagine you can't escape it .: null
    ? I just don't think, with that guy from Pittsburgh getting all that money, twentyseven
      or twentynine million or whatever it was, I just don't think that they're going
      to be able to sign Ruben Sierra
    : null
    I kind of think it was necessary,: null
    I know Yankees have won a lot games .: null
    I really think, I really think that, that they ought to,: null
    I say, if the guy can't play, you don't blame that,: null
    I tell you that would draw a crowd, wouldn't it.: null
    I tell you, we need a winner in this town.: null
    I think he deserves every penny of it.: null
    I think it's a little bit late in the season for them to assign us: null
    I think it's fun,: null
    I think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the other, Hispanic players.: null
    I think it's more fun to play than it is to watch.: null
    I think so.: null
    I think stadiums work tend to keep people happy.: null
    I think that helps a lot.: null
    I think that they have a, a lower of injuries,: null
    I think that's a, a great addition.: null
    I think that's all that they have.: null
    I think that's one of the most, enjoyable things about being up here.: null
    I think that's really what's been hurting, the, Rangers.: null
    I think that's the key, in he, his last year: null
    I think that, I think that's part of what, baseball needs more of.: null
    I think that, that a player ought to hit a home run if he's got the pitch to do it,: null
    I think that, with, so much controversy over Ruben Sierra not signing and asking us for so much money, it's, I think: null
    I think the Pirates will go.: null
    I think the Royals will do okay.: null
    I think the entire baseball,: null
    I think the odds are cut down.: null
    I think the, they happen more in football.: null
    ? I think they just want to stay mediocre and draw their two million fans out
      there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender
      in here.
    : null
    I think they should, pay him what his salary is going to be, and let him,: null
    I think they're doing better.: null
    I think they, I think they need them all.: null
    I think this is absolutely ridiculous.: null
    I think this town would go crazy if they ever got a, even a playoff team.: null
    I think we can address every topic,: null
    I think we were all pretty much, Astros fans, in the National League Championship Series: null
    I think with their new stadium, they should go and let,: null
    I think you're probably right, that they, that they need some, some changes in, pitching coach, maybe: null
    I think you, you don't know all that much more than I do about baseball .: null
    I think, I think the Rangers need to go: null
    I think, what caught so many of our attentions last year was that Nolan Ryan,: null
    I want to see them win, because damn it, they, the fans deserve it.: null
    I'd rather see the ball hit around and have the people,: null
    I'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money.: null
    I, I know they can get hurt in baseball too.: null
    I, I really love,: null
    ? I, I think going to the ball park just really makes it. Because then you watch
      it on T V you feel like you're more a part of it too.
    : null
    ? I, I think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going
      to be to the point where the average fan can't go
    : null
    I, I would say that baseball tends to be one of the less,: null
    I, I, I would, I would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there, several times a,: null
    In other words if you've got a player on your team who's helping your team, then keep him there.: null
    It kind of goes into about all aspects of society I think up here.: null
    It looks like our Cowboys are coming back: null
    It really doesn't,: null
    It sure would.: null
    It's a lot more fun when your not fighting a crowd.: null
    It's about to get,: null
    It's an interesting, an interesting concept of, of how they do it.: null
    It's going to be depending on where the, what they do with Ruben Sierra: null
    It's good when you go to Tom Thumb though: null
    It's just going to effect on the, the team,: null
    It's real aggravating,: null
    It's so stupid because they let you take it in there,: null
    It's, it's not, it's not too cool for kids.: null
    It, it really kind of depends on, on, what they were, what they were looking for.: null
    Like Oakland A's and the Giants: null
    Most of the time.: null
    Not lately though .: null
    Of course, you have to get there early if you want to get anything,: null
    One of the advantages of not having pitchers who are: null
    People are pretty excited about it.: null
    Some of them are not too happy about it: null
    That was a good movie, too.: null
    That was a, that was a series to remember, for sure.: null
    That was fun.: null
    That's a whole different sport.: null
    That's probably because of the roads.: null
    That's really stupid.: null
    That's so stupid that you all have two teams.: null
    That's something you dream about.: null
    That's typical bureaucracy though.: null
    That's, that's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums, I think.: null
    That's, that's, I think it's going to be any where you go: null
    The bat is a very heavy object, can do a lot of damage: null
    The only problem is it's not large enough.: null
    These guys have been pampered.: null
    They can't afford not to,: null
    They could do very well,: null
    They need to have some, some young guys that can take the lead: null
    They really are.: null
    They're doing the right thing, though,: null
    They're letting their farm system, build up and stuff like that: null
    This is America,: null
    Those are, those are, I think those are more fun than major league games sometimes.: null
    Those games are fun to watch.: null
    We are substantially north of New York enough that,: null
    We just can't seem to,: null
    When it starts costing you fifty or a hundred dollars to go to a game: null
    Which means that if you have a good year winning one ru, one run games that the following year, you'll have a bad year.: null
    You do these fun things, in other kinds of ways: null
    You don't expect them to be, much of anything but thugs.: null
    You just have to spend it if it's necessary.: null
    You probably can't afford to eat if you have more than .: null
    ? a guy, a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon and probably make five
      thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a
    : null
    a lot times people think, I'm not blessed: null
    a lot women at Foley's: null
    all he has to do is hit the ball,: null
    all he has to do is one, hit it once.: null
    all of a sudden he becomes a hero.: null
    anyway, it is interesting.: null
    as far as predictions and stuff, I really think the Rangers may come out real strong this year.: null
    at least, at least that will be exciting: null
    at the same time, I don't know, it's pretty far to throw that far .: null
    baseball is their, is their life up there like football is down here I think.: null
    baseball's baseball.: null
    being told what to do is worse.: null
    certainly if you look at them compared to, let's say, eight years ago or something, they're: null
    even in baseball you can,: null
    every team with the Indians been doing that now.: null
    every year they get thrown out.: null
    everything's on the west side.: null
    goll, how humiliating for a man to do that, any man.: null
    he ought to be able to perform,: null
    he really is.: null
    he really wasn't worth the baggage,: null
    he seemed to know what he was doing: null
    he sure is.: null
    he's just a, a, a little boy with a lot of money.: null
    he's still doing great: null
    he's supposed to be able to do that.: null
    he's very much due for a good year.: null
    he's, he certainly is a good example, for the kids.: null
    he's, he's such a nice man.: null
    heck, that's a lot cheaper then,: null
    hit it to him,: null
    if I owned the team. I think you'd like them to do well: null
    if he doesn't, then his market value will go down: null
    if he produces next year, they may have to end up paying him anyway,: null
    if it's a perfect shot, go for it,: null
    if you can't do it with men on base, there's something definitely wrong,: null
    if you had to, if you had to bet on who would be in the World Series, it would be really tough.: null
    if you have young, young children, they, they get a kick out of it.: null
    if you offer them money, I'm sure they'll,: null
    if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way, you: null
    in, in psychology doesn't address it.: null
    isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than football players would.: null
    it does so fast ,: null
    it ends with the World Series which usually takes place, I believe, in December or January.: null
    it is, it's incredible.: null
    ? it seems that what you really need to do to win though, is to have a team that
      has reasonable talent and has some people that have, have, have real breakthrough
      years.
    : null
    it should be an interesting year.: null
    it should, uhhuh.: null
    it sure should.: null
    it was a great deal for him: null
    it was int, it certainly was an exciting Series, anyway.: null
    it was just more for my money.: null
    it's a different kind: null
    it's a good idea,: null
    it's a long way away.: null
    it's a lot of losers .: null
    it's almost four hundred,: null
    it's always, it's always wondered me why, they act as though this area is not, a big metropolitan area,: null
    it's good because they, they try new things,: null
    it's good to have,: null
    it's hard to say.: null
    it's just going to be a shame for, our area.: null
    ? it's just incredible to think that there's, there are players who are the sons
      of ball players that used to play against Nolan
    : null
    it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones,: null
    it's kind of like Babe Ruth.: null
    it's like I said spending money doesn't guarantee you, winning a pennant.: null
    it's nice at night.: null
    ? it's really kind of, kind of late to, to start, be trying to trade for somebody,
      especially with the salary cap that the Rangers have.
    : null
    it's so crowded up there.: null
    it's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you,: null
    it's strangely enough, it's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year.: null
    ? it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working, your day job
      and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much
      money as they bring home in one game.
    : null
    it's time to, to either, put out or shut up.: null
    it's too bad that, it has to be a fortytwo year old guy to, to lead the, the Rangers,: null
    it's, it's pretty pervasive.: null
    it's, it's, it's, it's a heck of a drive.: null
    it's, it, it, it's a little bit like any other sport,: null
    it, it's an interesting concept, though, when you look at, of, of how baseball, how apparently,: null
    kids are just as much of a blessing material things: null
    last year I was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump.: null
    like I say, if they can, if they can get that one element that they were missing, I think the Giants can do it.: null
    man, that's getting old,: null
    maybe that has, has good tidings for their, for their season coming up.: null
    nobody has got them yet.: null
    of course, it was fun for you .: null
    once you do that, you lose everything,: null
    real Met fans don't like the Yankees: null
    real Yankee fans don't like the Mets for some reason.: null
    so this book it just really all these things and how to train the child: null
    some people we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that,: null
    sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad.: null
    sometimes when I, if you go out there during the day, you just fry under the sun.: null
    ? th, I think the best thing that you can do is go with, the players that are,
      that have the talent to do the best years. And, that they hadn't had these,
      gigantic, career years yet and,
    : null
    that could be your, fifteen minutes of fame.: null
    that makes a really big difference.: null
    that must have been hard on him because he's just a person: null
    ? that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next year,
      I think, if, I think, the young talent really just has to build itself up.
    : null
    that should help.: null
    that was a great deal for him.: null
    that's a lot of money.: null
    that's about, ten too many.: null
    that's all the game is.: null
    that's one of the things that I think Saint Louis has done,: null
    that's the name of the game, too.: null
    that's the way to do it.: null
    that, I think that's maybe part of it that, that the,: null
    that, they really are.: null
    the Rangers have a, have a pitching problem: null
    the Rangers really, knocked the socks off of them, which you would expect: null
    the depth of knowledge is quite different.: null
    the kind of cruel,: null
    the politics, the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes.: null
    the question is how do you forecast that,: null
    the question of losing big, big money that what, did, did, did Steinbrenner actually make money on the,: null
    the strike outs were a big problem for him,: null
    the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work, they just come out of the BIBLE: null
    the way I, the way I see it, is,: null
    the, then they can have them play against each other.: null
    their, their ticket prices are, kin, I guess as high as anybody else's: null
    there are a lot of Ranger fans around.: null
    there's definitely a lot more hitting .: null
    these two were definitely thugs,: null
    they are going with their farm system.: null
    they can pick him up for, for a lot less than,: null
    they don't have as much money.: null
    they don't have the offense to, to get out, or to have the, the more runs,: null
    they may be even be, better this year.: null
    they must play every day then.: null
    they need the pitching.: null
    they really do.: null
    they really don't have an excess of catchers: null
    they say that from that space needle up in Toronto you can see the lights of Rochester on a clear night.: null
    they sure could.: null
    they try every year: null
    they were pretty much thugs,: null
    they weren't scared very much, .: null
    they won the series byebye sort of a sneaky route, against Boston: null
    they're a good ball team.: null
    they're cheap: null
    they're the ones that probably are paying the highest.: null
    they're trying.: null
    they've got the hitting,: null
    think, the, he, that must have been on President Bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground,: null
    this last year, I'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years.: null
    training, training is different than anything else: null
    unfortunately the Rangers don't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do.: null
    when you get two strikes on you, you have a tend, you should, shorten your swing a little bit,: null
    when you go to the ball park, it's really not all that far: null
    whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question.: null
    which means the Rangers are going to have a terrible year,: null
    whoever built the city was an idiot, in my opinion,: null
    you blame the team, for putting him in,: null
    you can't live in Dallas without,: null
    you don't have to spend the big money, as far as I'm concerned to, to win.: null
    you don't know which is,: null
    you get tired of that.: null
    you have to just keep up with everything in the off season.: null
    you like to have someone like that you could point to say, see what a fine man, that, he is.: null
    you never know.: null
    you think we'd, someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the, the, the players we need.: null
    ? you, you've got to be able to get the two and three run home runs, to, to be
      able to, score enough runs to be able to win in these, in this day and age,

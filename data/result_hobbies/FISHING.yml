    I'm a fisher .: null
    I'm from Midland.: null
    I'm going to be retiring at the end of December,: null
    I'm in an area called Center County, which is in the very center of the State of Pennsylvania,: null
    I'm in an area where, we can, enjoy it year round,: null
    I'm mainly a freshwater fisherman.: null
    I'm not a catcher.: null
    I'm not highly proficient,: null
    I'm not so sure I'm good at it,: null
    I'm not too welcome around,: null
    I'm originally from the State of Virginia: null
    I'm passing it on to my children.: null

    I've actually been, been out within the past couple of weeks.: null
    I've been fishing in the, the ocean.: null
    I've been up there .: null

    I've seen what comes out of the ocean,: null
    I've told so many stories about the snakes: null
    I've tried it: null
    I've, I've caught them from, three or four inches long: null
    I've, I've seen it,: null
    I, I can't remember,: null
    I, I cast a ways.: null
    I, I don't blame you.: null
    I, I don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not.: null
    I, I don't think I'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly,: null
    I, I get seasick,: null
    I, I grew up fishing.: null
    I, I had no idea what it was.: null
    I, I hope, the next fishing season, that I can sort of get back in and, enjoy that.: null

    I, so really I haven't gone fishing for about two years now: null
    If it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places. They hold tournaments there, and everything.: null
    If we're doing good, we catch a catfish or two once in a while.: null
    If you want to go on a boat alone, it's like two hundred dollars a day.: null
    In fact, it snowed on us in, in, when was that?: null
    In the summer.: null
    It all depends on what I'm fishing for, and the time of day.: null
    It goes back and forth.: null
    It had real teeth, like human teeth,: null
    It just, just a slow reel: null
    It looks complicated to me.: null
    It seems like the success ratio, the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there.: null
    It takes us about three hours to get there.: null
    It was probably four inches in diameter or something like that: null
    It was u, it really, it didn't look like, it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died.: null
    It was, it was a, like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat.: null
    It weighs less than the line.: null
    It's a fairly new lake in Texas.: null
    It's a little fishing village that is,: null

    Kathy and Kevin Guy.: null
    Lake Ontario is right near here.: null
    Last time I went I actually was in Galveston trying to saltwater fish: null
    Last year, we had a, just a wonderful trip up to Travers Lake. * Trapper's Lake in Colorado?: null
    Maybe I'll just be so lucky.: null
    Most of my fishing has been in the saltwater.: null
    Most of the time, if we catch something, we'll take it home and eat it.: null
    ? Most of the time, we just fished, in the river although there were a lot of
      sand pits and things like that, that we could fish in.
    : null
    Mostly freshwater,: null
    Mostly just the lakes around here,: null
    Mostly trout in the mountains.: null
    My brother went off the coast of Maine,: null
    My dad has a lake cabin,: null
    My grandfather used to do that: null
    My husband would like to live there,: null
    My inlaws live on a lake, a little bit east of Dallas, kind of in the Piney Woods,: null
    My, my neighbor has gone before: null
    Not anymore.: null
    Now I never knew they were that, that big,: null
    Of course what I used to like to do though is go snorkeling for scallops: null
    Put them back .: null
    She's real sweet.: null
    Small island.: null
    Sometimes fish eggs.: null
    South Dakota didn't really have much for,: null
    T I is up there,: null
    Take a picnic lunch.: null
    That was real fun.: null
    That was what he considered fishing .: null
    That's about the only kind I know how to do.: null
    That's cold water around there.: null
    That's like this dog fish,: null
    That's one of the few things I've ever fished for is rainbow trout.: null
    That's really interesting.: null
    That's what I do a lot.: null
    That's what I told the guy.: null
    That's why I'm saying I love to go fishing because I've never caught anything really, really big.: null
    That, that was a really enjoyable, thing for me to do.: null
    The guy was standing there: null
    The last time I went, bass fishing,: null
    The ones around here are so big, that you can fish off the dock: null
    The only problem is I just moved to Texas: null
    The only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up.: null
    The trout fishing is really, beautiful.: null
    The water's kind of,: null
    ? The weirdest fishing experience I ever had. People to this day are still trying
      to figure out if I really caught what I think I caught.
    : null
    The, three and a half year old has just gotten to the point,: null
    There's a possibility, but that was so long ago: null
    They can't pull it in fast enough.: null
    They fight hard.: null
    They have a fish that's called an oyster cracker.: null
    They just, they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them.: null
    They love it,: null
    They say it's a dog fish, from everything I've described,: null
    They tend to use, I guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes,: null
    They were talking about going over there, and, and some time in the spring,: null
    They were throwing hell benders or, some other kind of treble hook lure: null
    They'll go after that in a heartbeat also. Just anything that really shines or spins.: null
    They've been inviting us to come up there in the summer.: null
    This year, he's gotten to where he can.: null
    To this day I don't want to get in the water,: null
    We actu, we have the, those little, the, the, the Great Lakes,: null
    We camped next to one, one time when we were there a couple of summers ago.: null
    We did not know what to do about it.: null
    We don't have,: null
    We had a house in Port Aransas.: null
    We have a lot of, couple of lakes in our area that are fil, just filled with good sized bass.: null
    We have, some friends who live on the lake: null
    We just dropped it down there: null
    We tend to use just bait.: null
    We went swimming one time, in the whole week that, we were there,: null
    We were in Mesa Verde Park,: null
    We were in, Rockport, which is close to Corpus: null
    We were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags, not knowing any better .: null
    We're about three hours from the ocean.: null
    We're both,: null
    We're not that big into fishing,: null
    We, I was the only one who did not catch,: null
    We, saw a large snake right off the dock there at my inlaws' place last year.: null
    We, skin them.: null
    We, we were at a friend's, stock pond, we were out at their farm,: null
    We, we weren't all related, just, thirty people off the shop in the boat there.: null
    What we normally do is just, go ahead and clean it up, and then, put it in a bag and freeze it.: null
    Whenever you have a, something that looks like something else: null
    Which isn't technically fishing,: null
    With the little thing on the end.: null
    You bait the hook,: null
    You can buy them.: null
    You don't even have to have a good rod or anything. Just, just even a regular line: null
    You fish upstream.: null
    You know how that changes, the phase of the moon: null
    You went to Galveston.: null
    You, you want to l, make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm: null
    a friend of mine: null
    a lot of them ended up being close to the river,: null
    a lure, a fly.: null
    a, a catfish will really just tear into anything like that, like liver: null
    according to them, you can catch, when the perch are running, you can catch them on just about anything.: null
    actually catching fish to eat per se, you don't really do much of that right there.: null
    actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me.: null
    actually we were, snapper fishing.: null
    all sorts of fun stuff like that.: null
    all the white water and noise the,: null
    all those people are here for the tournament,: null
    all we were catching were catfish,: null
    almost ever day.: null
    although we, use to set some, trout lines out: null
    and from the banks.: null
    anything that was fresh water was muddy: null
    as I say, I'm in Center County.: null
    as I say, it's been several years,: null
    at night you can go walking in the shallows, and gig flounder and things like that.: null
    at times she enjoys it, at times not.: null
    bait tends to work the best, just some blood bait.: null
    because I have relatives who live in Houston,: null
    because it's always been, in the, on a lake, and,: null
    believe me you'll know the difference.: null
    both times it was really pleasant.: null
    but just huge, ugly things: null
    catfish, yeah.: null
    corn or salami or bread or anything,: null
    crab, they don't bite like that,: null
    down here I haven't fished much in Texas.: null
    down here it's like two hundred dollars a day.: null
    down here, I have a brother that likes to go over on the east, in East Texas, and do fishing.: null
    during the Christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast: null
    each time they bring them in they'd have at least one,: null
    early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out,: null
    either as part of or separate from the, bill fishing tournaments they usually have: null
    even a lake.: null
    for me that's big.: null
    ? from what I'm seeing and hearing and all, the, the big pattern that's really
      looking forward for spring is the grub pattern.
    : null
    he caught fish.: null
    he even, even he started baiting my hook ,: null
    he has two ponds up there: null
    he laughed when it fell off: null
    he said it's one of the best bass fishing places.: null
    he said that he has never gone anywhere before,: null
    he started trying to cast it.: null
    he was fast.: null
    he was in a bad way.: null
    he was just here this past weekend.: null
    he'd maneuver us into a school of fish: null
    he's division three.: null
    he's fished all over the United States, in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen.: null
    he's in school,: null
    he, he said that it was just like that.: null
    he, he was kind of getting there: null
    here it went and it froze,: null
    his daughter caught fish,: null
    if I don't have a reel with a button on it, I tend to get so much backlash, it's not worth the trouble .: null
    if I went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing I would order if I had a choice of fish on the menu.: null
    ? if the river every, flooded, then obviously they would dump some catfish and
      bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits
    : null
    if you did it like you were just, saying, that's pretty much like rainbow trout.: null
    if you left it on the bottom, there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish.: null
    if you were there.: null
    in no time something would hit it: null
    in the summer time, they'll, give you a run for your money.: null
    in this particular lake, we went out with some friends, once: null
    it always smelled the entire time we were there.: null
    it can't be a fish.: null
    it gets f, foamy almost.: null
    it had the rock in its mouth, not the chicken,: null
    it has a huge strong mouth,: null
    it is fun, what little I do.: null
    it just wasn't working with my freshwater tackle.: null
    it looked archaic.: null
    it looked so bad: null
    it made a loud, almost a croaking noise like a croaker does: null
    it rained that night,: null
    it really tastes pretty good.: null
    it snowed on us.: null
    it was brown with these little white dots: null
    it was cold, and rain the whole time.: null
    it was incredible the size of them,: null
    it was just beautiful.: null
    it was like the end of Ju. It was just before July fourth.: null
    it was really your spring almost,: null
    it was so big, that it might not would have hurt us,: null
    it was the ugliest fish I've ever seen in my life.: null
    it was twentyeight, twentynine degrees.: null
    it was when I was a child.: null
    it was, it scared me to death.: null
    it was, it was really, really, really bad.: null
    it wasn't hooked very well.: null
    it will stay relatively well .: null
    it's a fly, you call it a pattern.: null
    it's a real small .: null
    it's a real, it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we just, we pull up, bass after bass: null
    it's been a little over a year now: null
    it's driving me crazy: null
    it's just pure and pristine.: null
    it's kind of fun.: null
    it's like if you drew a line from Austin straight down, it would be in that region.: null
    it's like, maybe we ought to move just a touch.: null
    it's mostly from the rivers and lakes.: null
    it's the opposite when you're fishing from a boat.: null
    it's what you do every day.: null
    it's, it was sixteen inches long.: null
    it's, it's full of carp I caught a carp on a, about, what size is that, I think it was a number two treble hook,: null
    it's, it's so close to the dock that I think all I do is feed them a little bit: null
    it's, it's, that's, a lot of fun.: null
    it's, they do a lot of shark fishing in that, in the gulf: null
    it, it was the strangest thing.: null
    it, of course, it scared the women to death,: null
    its, its mouth was full of hooks.: null
    just put, his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up .: null
    just strung up,: null
    just, usually worms, night crawlers.: null
    let it sit on the bottom,: null
    like what your talking about.: null
    mainly I, I want to say I brought something home.: null
    maybe division one right now.: null
    most of my fishing is done at, area lakes around here, freshwater lakes: null
    most of them are just the small, pan frying ones.: null
    mostly lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because I used to live in Utah.: null
    mostly we catch carp.: null
    mostly, a, a little fresh water fish,: null
    mountain streams and rivers.: null
    my dad has a farm: null
    my daughter caught fish,: null
    my home is in, Pensacola, Florida: null
    my uncle has a, a pond upstream: null
    ? normally I like to, to go out fishing in a boat, and, rather than bank fishing,
      and just to try and catch anything that's swimming, because I've had such problems
      with trying to catch any type of fish, that, I just really enjoy doing the boat
      type fishing.
    : null
    not be a very good conversationalist on fishing.: null
    not exactly like,: null
    now that we are down here, I think a lot of people do some, bass fishing and strip bass fishing: null
    occasionally I'll catch an eel: null
    occasionally we'd go out on a, full day trip, three or four other people: null
    of course there's no hook,: null
    of course, being raised on the water I'd never swim in it.: null
    of course, depending on how big your bait was, would be depending on what you caught.: null
    one of my favorite things was, we were forever catching crab and steaming them: null
    ? one of these days, I will go over to, Lake Lewisville or, Ray Hubbard, Lake
      Ray Hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while
      .
    : null
    one of these days, I'm hoping they'll have some kind of medicine,: null
    one time we were there,: null
    our, our streams here are replanted with fish about every year: null
    personally I like to catch large mouth bass: null
    pretty close.: null
    probably during, during perch season the perch will run in very large schools,: null
    really, huge sharks: null
    scared me to death.: null
    seems to stick in my mind, five to seven dollars: null
    she d, she's really a good fisher woman.: null
    she has a lot of those, those little,: null
    she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything,: null
    some fish steal it off the hook sometimes.: null
    some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night: null
    somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd.: null
    something grabs and just runs with it.: null
    sometimes I use corn,: null
    sometimes they've had two on, one on every hook.: null
    sometimes those are good to, do on a barbecue grill: null
    that I was able to do, when I could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom.: null
    that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away .: null
    that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water: null
    that part of it would probably work out .: null
    that was a lot of fun.: null
    that was kind of funny.: null
    that way you can feel when they're hitting it,: null
    that would be neat to,: null
    that's a different kind of fishing off the pier, too.: null
    that's a lot of fun.: null
    that's how we do it too.: null
    that's pretty much the same way here.: null
    that's really about it.: null
    that's the way my mother taught me to fry them: null
    that's what I mean cause I am from Iowa.: null
    that's what I said.: null
    that, that's a pretty good fight.: null
    the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits and, and jigs.: null
    the captain had, some kind of sonar in the boat: null
    the catfish, there's, there's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and, that,: null
    the creek was just wild, just running.: null
    the first thing I caught was a sand shark, which was probably a foot,: null
    the first time I went surf fishing was in ,: null
    the fish would be sitting at different levels.: null
    the key is to always have your line tight.: null
    the lake is beautiful,: null
    the licenses weren't that expensive,: null
    the little one, of course, is, could care less.: null
    the men come out and said that's only a, a king snake, it won't really hurt you,: null
    the next morning they would have them strung up across the: null
    the ones I caught were never large enough to really do anything.: null
    the only thing up here,: null
    the other day I was fishing with bread,: null
    the other little creatures would take care of what was left.: null
    the rest of the time we stayed in the pool, because the water was so awful,: null
    the rock itself: null
    the skin just basically scrapes right off: null
    the striped bass have accommodated themselves to the big fresh water lakes,: null
    the trout fishing is supposed to be legendary.: null
    the, I guess the creek, the mountains were really starting to melt,: null
    the, the other thing that's real good is small,: null
    the, the water was murky,: null
    the, the, turtles try to eat up all my bait .: null
    their tails would still hang on the bottom of the: null
    then I felt something relatively heavy,: null
    there are, there are a few lakes of course, close: null
    there you fish mornings and evenings.: null
    ? there's a certain period of time during the year they have all along the gulf
      coast from, I guess from Galveston to Mayport they have, shark tournaments,
    : null
    there's a college across the street: null
    there's a lake maybe two or three miles from here,: null
    there's a lot of crappie in there now.: null
    there's a lot of lakes around here.: null
    there's a pretty good crowd there,: null
    there's bumble bee patterns: null
    there's not a whole lot of different kinds.: null
    there's this one kind of cheese that you can put on the end of a hook: null
    there's, there's so much water around: null
    these are, real good, for, bass fishing and so forth.: null
    these people own a little row boat,: null
    they actually, use their teeth to open oysters.: null
    they almost look neon.: null
    they are probably fifteen, twenty acres maybe: null
    they are really, good fighters: null
    they are, definitely: null
    they can, they're, they're certainly ugly.: null
    they come in all si,: null
    they do a lot of fishing there.: null
    they do, of course,: null
    they don't just run with your food.: null
    they go fishing, up there.: null
    they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area,: null
    ? they had been fishing and let him use the pole while we wal, we all walked off
      a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish.
    : null
    they have a lot of bass tournaments.: null
    they have a tail race over in Lake Lavon: null
    they have like yellow, fuzz on a hook, that kind of comes out.: null
    they have snakes over there,: null
    they have the, Lake Texoma right next to them.: null
    they like to fish.: null
    they live in little shallow, little coves that I like to fish in,: null
    they look just like baby catfish.: null
    they really like that.: null
    they troll it a little bit.: null
    they wash, when they open up the dam and let out water, they wash down the fish: null
    they'll be boating around: null
    they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want.: null
    they'll hit a, they'll hit a school of perches in the middle: null
    they'll say, there's a big bass tournament this weekend,: null
    they'll, they'll, they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded, these large schools.: null
    they're a little heavier: null
    they're big fun.: null
    they're bigger.: null
    they're just real color, colorful: null
    they're pretty exciting when they're, when they're running.: null
    they're pure sil, all silver, something real shiny about that long.: null
    they're really not,: null
    they're sort of like, I want to say flies,: null
    they, they just drop it in.: null
    ? this is great, because it was, I think it was nineteen dollars for five hours
      and twenty dollars for six hours or something.
    : null
    this is the ugliest,: null
    this is, of course, X number of weeks or months before fishing season opens: null
    this, this, this was for a, large,: null
    three and a half pounds, and that was,: null
    unless you have a boat you can't really get into the, where they call the good fishing holes,: null
    up in, South Dakota on the, in the Missouri River there we've, tied into a few northern pike: null
    usually you pull up, thirteen to fourteen inch bass.: null
    very. very much there,: null
    we catch a bunch of junk . Nothing, nothing to talk about for the most part,: null
    we did a lot of fishing when we were up there.: null
    we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes.: null
    we do most of our fishing at night.: null
    we don't ever catch enough to eat.: null
    we figured we were up a long way off.: null
    we go ahead and eat those.: null
    we go there for the small lake, just outside of the Dallas Fort Worth area.: null
    we go, and we fish,: null
    we got him a little pole last year,: null
    we got up the next day,: null
    we had been fishing in a canal,: null
    we have a lot of cotton mouth,: null
    we have a lot of, beautiful fresh water streams that come through thi, this area.: null
    we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on Lake Ontario every year.: null
    we have a, qui, actually quite a lot of variety.: null
    we have large mouth, small mouth, sort of musky, pike, stuff like that.: null
    we have those.: null
    we just, every time you tossed the line in, you pull up a five, six, seven inch minimum bass: null
    we moved to, South Dakota: null
    we still had a good time out,: null
    we sure felt like it was hurting us, just being there, .: null
    we thought maybe there are some crab in here,: null
    we thought, wonder how far off we are?: null
    we use to catch those little bullheads: null
    we use worms and shiners, which is pretty much like minnows: null
    we used to catch some, sand bass off Lake, there's a Roosevelt Bridge: null
    we used to have a light at the top of the water.: null
    we went fishing there last memorial day, *Memorial Day: null
    we were pretty bored with that.: null
    we would do a lot of fishing there too: null
    we would go and just, drop two, a, a two or three rig, two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat.: null
    we'd been fishing in the canals: null
    we'll try to catch some crab.: null
    we're in what's called the Finger Lake Region of New York: null
    ? we're only just a few, not a few minutes, we're, forty five minutes to an hour
      away from the eastern shore here in Maryland
    : null
    we've caught, fourteen, fifteen pound catfish: null
    we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry.: null
    we've never entered a tournament or anything.: null
    we, I was out in Florida with a friend a while ago: null
    we, we have gotten out on, on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much,: null
    we, we were grouper fishing,: null
    what they'll do is j,: null
    what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom and crank up,: null
    what you do is, you strip off, four, five, six little rolls, coils, of line into your hand.: null
    whatever the fish is the specialist in that area, I, I enjoy fishing for it,: null
    when I fish, it's more for sport than anything else.: null
    when I get tired of them outwitting me, I fish for catfish: null
    when I go on one of the large lakes that we have here that I enjoy fishing for, for trout from that,: null
    when the water is cold, they are very slow moving fish,: null
    when they do, you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at,: null
    when they pull in, there's a snake instead of a fish,: null
    when would go, we would go to Port Aransas or then, on down to Corpus or further,: null
    when you were,: null
    where there're lots of small lakes everywhere: null
    you catch blues: null
    you catch that white bass and crappie out of there.: null
    you could pull them up two and three times in a row,: null
    you do it again.: null
    you don't have to really get, fish from a boat, because they're actually right there at the shore.: null
    you had to find out what level, how many cranks they were off the bottom.: null
    you just drop it in it just,: null
    you just leave it at that level: null
    you let it carry it downstream.: null
    you reel it in,: null
    you splash in: null
    you throw it in,: null
    you throw it out: null
    you troll it: null
    you whip the line.: null
    ? you'd get to go out there for, five, for, for six hours and get a nice suntan
      and bring along some lunch and, and fish all day.
    : null
    you'll, you'll be sort of boating around,: null
    you're in to it just a little bit,: null
    you're, how your line goes,: null
    you've got to have,: null
    you've got to work for a living.: null
    you, you get one or two at a shot,: null
    you, you stand on the edge and you, you cast out and you, you work, from your feet most of the time: null
  Statement-opinion: !!set
    Boy they d, they really don't want to come out of the water: null
    Colorado is a beautiful place to live.: null
    Fish in Colorado s, different than that.: null
    Fishing is not just, just dragging fish out of the water.: null
    I mean incredibly large sharks.: null
    I think I know where, Lake Caddo, or something like that.: null
    I think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish,: null
    I think there's a lot of people that have, really, I guess that you'd call it really sport fishing,: null
    I think they're good to eat.: null
    I think we're probably close, though.: null
    It most certainly is, so, so that, it, it was, it was certain things that were enjoyable about it,: null
    It takes time.: null
    It's not a treat: null
    It's real enjoyable.: null
    It's really nice .: null
    It's, it's a total experience, getting out in nature and,: null
    On a like that's not a bad size fish. *listen; transcript should probably read "lake" not "like": null
    Swimming is for swimming,: null
    That looks awful tiring .: null
    That would be fun.: null
    That would have been something.: null
    That's one advantage you've certainly got on us.: null
    That's where you swim.: null
    That's why they call them swimming pools .: null
    The peace and calmness is really relaxing.: null
    There's so many different ways to catch fish.: null
    You do not swim in the ocean.: null
    all they're good for is the fight.: null
    be careful you don't get stung.: null
    it is, it's very, a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around.: null
    it seems more relaxing, there's more to look at.: null
    it's a big problem.: null
    it's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish.: null
    it's a lot of fun.: null
    it's just so dreadfully expensive,: null
    it, it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden.: null
    ? it, the lake it just seems, is, is completely filled with bass to the point
      where, normally you go, y, y, go fishing for bass, you get a lot of sunfish,
      or, or cat or whatever, and some other strange stuff. *listen
    : null
    long as you have a good time, that's the main point: null
    maybe I can learn something.: null
    seems like every time somebody's on the bank, all they want to do is throw it out just as far as they can: null
    that sounds like fun.: null
    that would be nice.: null
    that's a good size fish .: null
    that's a pretty big fish.: null
    that, that's true,: null
    there are people who catch.: null
    there are people who fish,: null
    there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing,: null
    there's just so many other ways live down there.: null
    there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul .: null
    these aren't huge lakes from your point of view: null
    they're really into it to try to win.: null
    they're scary looking.: null
    when you, when you have to look in their eyes and, hit them in the head or whatever, that's what you do with a catfish: null
    you guys sure want to be out of range.: null
    you sound like you're a good fisher woman, too.: null
